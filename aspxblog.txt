                                <p>
                                    Hunt for the best <a target="_blank" href="/europe-group-tour-packages" class='lnks'>Europe tour packages</a>: Find out about European Vacation tour packages offered by famous Swiss travel agencies and do a comparative analysis. Select the European tour package that covers all you want and caters to your needs along with offering competitive prices.

However, this can be costly as well as exhausting. Choose the destinations that you can cover hassle-free in your number of days
	
                                </p>
                                <p>Streamline your budget: Adjust by cutting or adding things to your itinerary to fit your budget. Don't try to cover everything in one trip. It will get you hassled and exhausted. Choose places and events that can fit within your budget. If 2 places are almost similar, choose one place which is easily approachable and ignore the other one.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Don't overlook location for small hotel savings: If you are confused to decide between hotels and <a target="_blank" href="/apartments" class='lnks'>apartments in Switzerland</a>, then you should give preference to the hotel with the more central location.

The Swiss Travel Pass will allow you unlimited travel on all public transport, up to 50% discounts on mountain excursions and free access to over 500 museums. In fact, almost all the attractions that we will visit in this program are covered by the Swiss Travel Pass for some discount.</p>

                                        <p>Check in to your hotel, freshen up and head out to see this beautiful lakeside town.  Start off with the gorgeous Chillon Castle (20 minutes by bus number 201 from Montreux), built on an outcrop on the lakeshore. The Chateau de Chillon has, at different times in its history, been an armoury, a prison and even a hospital. It is also the inspiration behind the poem 'The Prisoner of Chillon' by Lord Byron. This is Switzerland's most visited monument, so visit it and find out why.</p>
                                        <p>Note: The castle closes at 5 pm, so ensure you are there on time.</p>
                                        <p>Take the bus back to Montreux and explore the lovely lakeside promenade. Make sure to take a photo with the legendary Freddie Mercury, whose statue holds a prime spot overlooking the beautiful bay. If you are a Freddie and Queen fan like me, check out the 'Queen: The Studio Experience' exhibition at the Casino Barrière. Visit Montreux's beautiful Old Town with its cobble-stoned streets, historic old houses and fabulous views over the lake and surrounding Alps.</p>

Don't stress; Zermatt is not just for skiers and winter sports enthusiasts. In fact, Zermatt is home to the world's most photographed mountain- The Matterhorn, which is said to be the inspiration behind the peculiar triangular shape of one of Switzerland's most popular chocolates. Yes, you guessed right ..the Toblerone.

                                            One of the best places to view and photograph the Matterhorn is the <a target="_blank" href="/mountain-excursion/7-matterhorn-glacier-paradise" class='lnks'>Matterhorn Glacier Paradise</a> (also known as Kleine Matterhorn).  Take a bus or a leisurely 20-minute walk to the cable car station of the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise. Make your way to the peak by cable car via two changes en route. Once at the peak, you can head to the viewing platform,  walk through the Ice Palace and enjoy a snack or meal with the best view you can imagine.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Upon returning to Zermatt, walk through this lovely car-free village, visit the historical quarter 'Hinterdorf', the Matterhorn Museum and, time permitting, the Gorner Gorge (summer months) before heading back to Montreux.</p>
                                        <p>Note: A jacket, sturdy shoes and goggles are a must when travelling to the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise in any season.</p>

                                        <p>Try to leave Montreux by 7.30 am and take a train to Gstaad (roughly 1.40 hours). On arrival in Gstaad, walk along the town's pedestrian centre with its boutiques, cafes and designer stores. Pop into the 18th-century Gstaad church with its dominating steeple and enjoy a coffee and snack before leaving for your next stop of the day- Gruyeres (roughly 1.20 hours).</p>
                                        <p>Just minutes from the Gruyeres station is the Gruyeres cheese factory  (free with your Swiss Travel Pass), where you can see a live demonstration of the process of cheese making (check the timings of the live demonstrations so you can arrive accordingly). Enjoy the offered samples of a few different kinds of cheese before you start your audio-guided tour of the facility. If hunger strikes, have a cheesy meal in the restaurant at the factory before you walk or take a bus to Gruyeres town. The medieval, pedestrian-only town with its cobble-stoned streets looks just out of a fairytale. Visit the Chateau de Gruyeres, which houses a museum and also offers fantastic views over the surrounding area.</p>
                                        <p>As the announcements in Swiss trains go, “Next halt- Broc”. From Gruyeres, take a train to Broc (roughly 30 minutes). The Maison Cailler chocolate factory (free with your Swiss Travel Pass)  is just outside the train station. Trust me when I say I think I could have followed the divine scent of fresh chocolate to the factory if I had been blindfolded! Once there, you can go on a multimedia tour to learn all about the history and process of chocolate making. You could even opt for a pre-booked chocolate-making course.</p>
                                        <p>Keep a note of the time since you have to make your way back to Montreux (roughly 1.30 hours).</p>

                                        <p>After covering the western region from Montreux, we move to <a target="_blank" href="/blog/interlaken-switzerland" class='lnks'>Interlaken</a> and make it our base for the coming days. Not only is Interlaken perfectly located, it is also conveniently connected to all other major towns.</p>
                                        <p>After a journey of roughly 2.30 hours from Montreux, check in or leave your luggage at the hotel and leave for Grindelwald (35 minutes). Walk for a few minutes to the cable car station of Grindelwald First and hop on a cable car to the peak.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <a target="_blank" href="/mountain-excursion/9-grindelwald-first" class='lnks'>Grindelwald First</a> offers some amazing views from the peak. From there, walk to the Cliff Walk by Tissot, which is a metal bridge along the side of the cliff with a viewing platform in the middle. Take in the stunning views of the surrounding Alpine territory before you head back. Ready to descend down the mountain in the most fun way? Choose some or all four fun activities that take you from the peak back to the base station.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Start off with the Ice Flyer - get strapped into single seats and zip down an 800-metre cable at 84 km/hr.</p>
                                        <p>Next is the First Glider - enjoy soaring down an 800m long route at 72km/hr while being securely strapped face down under the wings of a giant eagle.</p>
                                        <p>After this, get on the Mountain Cart and steer yourself down a three-kilometre route from Schreckfeld to Bort. The three-wheeled low-to-the-ground vehicle has wide tyres and hydraulic brakes, which give you full control of the speed you wish to travel at.</p>
                                        <p>Lastly, the Trotti bike - this motorised two-wheeler with a wide footboard and large tyres will take you down the last leg of the descent back to the base station.</p>
                                        <p>On reaching Grindelwald, walk through this picturesque alpine village, have a meal (there are many food outlets around the station) and head back to Interlaken.</p>
                                        <p>Note: Please check the age/weight requirements and the days of operation of the activities at Grindelwald First</p>
                                        <p>An early start from Montreux today will ensure you have enough time to enjoy the mountain.</p>

                                            To reach Jungfraujoch, take a train to Grindelwald, followed by a cable car to the Eigergletscher station, and then, once again, take a train for the last leg of the journey to the peak. This journey takes 1.15 hours.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>You can also take a whole train journey, but that takes a little longer (2 hours).</p>
                                        <p>At the peak, head to the viewing terrace for the most spectacular views. Walk through the Ice Palace with its lifelike ice sculptures and visit the Alpine Sensation to learn a little about the history of the Jungfrau railways. Needless to say, don't forget to stock up on chocolates from the Lindt Chocolate Heaven before you start your descent.</p>
                                        <p>If you have taken the cableway up, you can choose to make the train journey back and choose a train that goes to Lauterbrunnen (not Grindelwald, which you have already visited). This way, you will see one more gorgeous village in the Bernese Oberland region. Lauterbrunnen is also known as 'The Valley of 72 waterfalls'. Visit and find out why.</p>

Walk along the Hoheweg, Interlaken’s main street, which stretches between Interlaken East and West stations. The Hoheweg is a 2 km long road with shops and cafes. You can find top jewellery and watch brands, fashion boutiques, souvenir shops and plenty of cafes.<br />
                                            If you crave some Swiss chocolatey stuff, head for the Funky Chocolate Club for some sinfully chocolatey food and beverages. Spend some family-and-friends time sharing a fondue at one of the cafes along the Hoheweg. Interlaken, as the name suggests, is located between the two gorgeous Lakes Thun and Brienz. You can take a boat ride on any one of these.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>There are many picturesque villages to explore around Interlaken. One such village is Iseltwald (roughly 20 minutes by bus) known as the 'Pearl of Lake Brienz'. It is absolutely picture-perfect and has been the location of several scenes from the famous series Crash Landing On You.</p>

The journey of roughly 1.50 hours can be done on the lovely <a target="_blank" href="/mountain-excursion/56-luzern-interlaken-express" class='lnks'>Lucerne-Interlaken Express</a> via some of the most breathtaking scenery. On arrival in Lucerne, head for the boat pier just outside the station and hop on a ferry to reach the <a target="_blank" href="/mountain-excursion/35-swiss-transport-museum" class='lnks'>Swiss Museum of Transport</a>, Switzerland's most visited museum.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Get off at the ferry terminal Verkehrshaus-Lido and make your way to the museum. This museum showcases the history of air, rail, water, road and even space transport in the most fun and interactive way. It also houses a cinema with Switzerland’s largest screen, a planetarium and the lovely Swiss Chocolate Adventure attraction, an interactive activity to learn about the history of chocolate (and get to taste it at the end).<br />
                                            After you have spent a couple of hours at the museum, head back to Lucerne and explore this gorgeous lakeside town.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Walk across the Chapel Bridge, Europe's oldest wooden covered bridge. Read about the history of the bridge on the information boards, marvel at the 30 remaining paintings on the roof panel (almost 120 of these paintings were lost in a fire) and get some perfect pictures at one of Switzerland's most iconic structures (for me this is the most iconic structure).</p>
                                        <p>
                                            After seeing the bridge and the nearby watchtower ( even older than the bridge), visit Lucerne's Altstadt (Old Town) with its narrow cobble-stoned streets, frescoed houses and artsy boutiques.<br />
                                            After lunch at the Old Town or along a lakeside cafe, walk to the Lion Monument, a gigantic sculpture of a lion pierced by a spear. This moving sculpture honours the Swiss Guards massacred in the French Revolution.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>From here, head to the Musegg wall, which was once Lucerne's medieval city wall. Climb one of the towers to get stunning views across the city. See one of Lucerne's oldest working clocks (in the Zyt Tower), which strikes the hour one minute before all other clocks in the town.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Make your way back to Lucerne Main Station. Don't forget to grab a meal somewhere in town or at the station since you have an almost two-hour journey back to Interlaken.

You can take a train to the station Schloss Laufen Am Rhein, which is adjacent to the waterfalls. Feel the thunderous roar and refreshing mist of the falls while standing at one of the viewing platforms. The falls, which stand 23 metres high and 150 metres wide, unleash several hundred cubic metres of water per second. In the summertime, you can take a boat and go really close to the falls. If you still have some adventure left in you, climb to the Middlerock towering above the centre of the falls. It stands at roughly 30 meters and requires a climb of over 100 steps.</p>
                                        <p>If you have some time upon your return to Zurich, you can walk along the Bahnofstrasse, the premier shopping street stretching 1.4 kilometres from Zurich Main Station to the lakeside. Stroll through shops showcasing all of Europe's finest watches, jewellery, fashion, and high street brands. Have an al fresco meal at one of the cafes along the lakeside before you head for the airport.</p>
                                        <p>Try to keep some time for shopping at Zurich airport. Besides stocking up on your last-minute chocolate and cheese, you can also indulge in some luxury shopping for Swiss watches, jewellery and fashion before you depart.</p>

Without the benefits of Swiss Pass, travellers would have to pay for every train, bus or tram ride from point to point. This not only becomes a time-waster while you're on a tight schedule but also turns out much more expensive. </p>

This means, the pass covers the cost of your full price point-to-point ticket, which is a massive saving.

                                        <p>These markets with their Christmas trees, twinkling lights and Christmas music (sometimes choirs) just make the already beautiful surroundings more magical. The markets have all kinds of stalls selling locally produced foods and drinks (amazing cheese, and dairy products, preserves, gingerbread and of course wines!) </p>
                                        <p>There is an amazing array of Christmas buntings, clothes, artefacts and jewelry. There are skating rinks and other entertainment rides that the kids can enjoy as well.  </p>
                                        <p>Among the more popular markets to visit in Switzerland in the winter are the ones in Basel, Bern, Montreux and Zurich. </p>
                                        <p>However smaller towns like Rapperswiil, Murten and Stein Am Rhein also hold beautiful Christmas markets.  </p>

                                        <p>There are also amazing food stalls to help with the hunger that you will no doubt feel after using up some energy at the rinks.  </p>
                                        <p>Despite what most people think, you do not need to know your way on the ice since most skating rinks offer skating aids that help non-skaters to try their hand at the sport too. </p>
                                        <p>Interlaken is also one of the prettiest places in the country situated between the 2 lakes of Thun and Brienz (thus the name Interlaken- meaning between 2 lakes).   </p>

From comforting and homey dishes to refined meals and mouth-watering desserts, this country has it all.

                                            Only the Swiss can turn a simple cheese and bread dish into a social ritual. This typical Swiss dish of melted cheese (the word Fondue comes from the French verb 'fondre'- to melt) can be found across Switzerland and in almost all types of restaurants.

                                            The dish itself comes in a sort of communal dish of melted cheese (Gruyere and Emmental) around which fellow foodies dip their bread. Don't forget to keep stirring the cheese to keep it smooth and creamy. Pair this with a nice white wine for a good balance of flavours.

                                            Here's one more typically Swiss way to enjoy melted cheese. Raclette (once again derived from the French verb 'racler'- to scrape) is melted cheese poured directly from a melting wheel of cheese onto baby jacket potatoes, pickled onions, gherkins and fruit. Almost all traditional Swiss restaurants will have Raclette on offer.

                                            Made of pan-fried grated potatoes with toppings of bacon, fried egg and cheese, Rosti is like a potato pancake. The sliced or grated potato is closely packed and brought to a heavenly golden brown exterior with a soft centre. It is typically found in most traditional restaurants and even more so in the German-speaking part of Switzerland.

                                            This earthy brown broth combines browned flour, beef stock, butter and onions topped with grated Gruyere cheese. Sometimes, it is enhanced with red wine. The name, which literally means Basel flour soup, is native to Basel and is traditionally served at the Fasnacht (Basel's annual celebration that comes before Lent in the Christian calendar).

                                            It is said that a chatty cook once burnt the flour while preparing soup and, instead of starting from scratch again, decided to take the wrong and make it right somehow. He decided to continue roasting the flower in butter, added the beef stock to it and in doing this, turned it into the phenomenally popular dish that it is today.

                                            Alplermagronen, or Alpine macaroni, is like mac and cheese, only better. It was originally a dish meant to help local farmers gain the energy needed to work on harsh Alpine terrain. It's made of macaroni and potato cubes in a cheesy, creamy sauce and served with apple sauce and fried onions. While the addition of apple sauce may seem odd to mac and cheese buffs, trust me, it takes the dish to another level.

                                            Made of pan-fried veal strips, cream, beef stock, mushrooms and wine, this ragout has a rich flavour of herbs, parsley and lemon zest. Said to have originated in the Zurich area, this popular dish is now available in restaurants throughout the region. It is typically served with a side of rosti; a must-include in your <a target="_blank" href="/blog/switzerland-itinerary-8-days" class='lnks'>Switzerland itinerary</a>.

                                            Today, the world has accepted muesli as a healthy breakfast meal. However, not many know that it was invented by a Swiss physician named Maximilian Bircher-Benner, who came up with it as an optimally beneficial breakfast for his patients. It is made of oats, seeds, nuts like walnuts and almonds, soaked overnight in yoghurt or milk. It is best enjoyed chilled and topped off with seasonal fruits and honey.

                                            The Bundner Nusstorte from the Graubünden region is a shortbread pastry tart filled with caramel and nuts (most typically walnuts). You will probably see a slice of these being enjoyed along with a coffee or tea.

                                            The Basler Lackerli which as the name suggests, hails from the town of Basel. It's a spiced  biscuit made of flat baked dough. It gets its flavour from ingredients like hazelnut, almonds, honey, candied orange peel and kirsch (cherry brandy).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There are also seasonal and festive desserts. In summer, look for raspberry or apricot cakes. The Swiss really enjoy their 'Kaffe und Kuchen' (coffee and cake) and so will you. Come Christmas, keep an eye out for the pretty Spitzbuben biscuits made from a buttery dough with a layer of jam. They come beautifully decorated in various festive shapes.

                                            By far, Switzerland's most famous food is chocolate. The average Swiss person consumes over 10 kilograms of chocolate per year, making them the world's biggest chocolate consumers! Known for its high standards of ingredients, smooth creamy texture and striking innovative combinations of flavours, Swiss chocolate is renowned worldwide.

                                            Many brands like Lindt, Sprungli, Toblerone and Cailler are now global names, but there are so many smaller local artisanal chocolatiers that one must try when in Switzerland. My favourites are Max Chocolatier and Laderach in Lucerne.

The most popular places, though, are the <a target="_blank" href="/mountain-excursion/47-lindt-chocolate" class='lnks'>Lindt Chocolate Museum</a> in Zurich and the Nestle-Caillers factory, which you can visit on the Chocolate Train from Montreux and on which you get a sizable <a target="_blank" href="/blog/top-discounts-on-swiss-travel-pass" class='lnks'>discount with your Swiss Travel Pass</a>.

                                            <u>Wines</u>: Switzerland has 15,000 hectares of vineyards, and the locals consume almost all of it (the average consumption is 34 litres per person). Some of the more famous wine growing regions are Ticino, Valais and Vaud (you have likely come across pictures of the UNESCO protected terraced vineyards of Lavaux in this region). These regions are known for their wines like the Pinot Noir, Chasselas (made from the rarer Chasselas grape celebrated for its light notes), Gamay and Chardonnay.

                                            There are tours that show you around the vineyards, where you can meet the families who cultivate them, and of course, sample and purchase the wines. Make sure you buy some to take home with you. Like I mentioned, Swiss wine is not easy to find abroad because almost all of it is consumed locally.

                                        <p>To see the falls up close you can even hike all the way. Some sections even take you behind the waterfalls where you can actually feel the spray and hear the roar of the falls as they thunder downward.  </p>
                                        <p>If your kids are not up to the hike, there is also a small playground nearby. Instead of taking the funicular down, you can also walk back so that you get a good view of the falls from a lower level.  </p>

                                        <p>If you are staying in Zurich or even in Lucerne, you can make a day trip to the Rhine Falls - the biggest waterfalls in Europe. </p>
                                        <p>You can reach the falls within an hour with a train from Zurich (the nearest station to the falls is Schloss laufen am Rheinfall). </p>
                                        <p>It is one of the best things to do in Switzerland in May and July since the glaciers melt during this time and the density of water peaks.</p>
                                        <p>You can also take a boat trip which takes you closer to the falls and feel the icy refreshing splash of the water. The cost of the boat trips vary depending on their duration (from CHF 8 to CHF 20). </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Lord Byron was so fascinated by the castle he penned the poem The Prisoner of Chillon. He also carved his name on one of the pillars of the castle!
The castle can take almost half a day to cover and can be done either as an independent or a guided tour. Make sure you take the audio guide so that you learn about the 14th century paintings, subterranean vaults and parade halls.  
                                        </p>
                                        <p>In case you are not staying in Montreux, you can also do this as a day trip from Lausanne or Geneva.</p>
                                        <p>Tip: The entrance to the castle is free for holders of the Swiss Travel Pass holders.  </p>

                                        <p>This option is valid on 3, 4, 8 or 15 freely selectable days within one month rather than 3,4,8 or 15 consecutive days offered in a continuous pass. </p>
                                        <p>The Flexi Swiss Travel Passholders can enjoy the same benefits as that of the consecutive passholders but only on the days of travel chosen.</p>
                                        <p>Travellers who want the comfort of a car but also want the best deals on the mountains and other benefits of the pass should opt for the Flexi option. That way, they can use the pass on certain days and get the best deals on those days. </p>

                                            <b>Our Verdict:</b>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Overall travelling within Switzerland is definitely more expensive than in other European countries, but the Swiss Travel Pass is one of its kind when it comes to benefits and value for money. </p>
                                        <p>No other country offers a worthy pass that's valid on all modes of transport and so many non-transport benefits. </p>
                                        <p>What better way than to experience a country like a local? </p>
                                        <p>Don't miss out on one of the most punctual and efficient transport systems of the world. </p>
                                        <p>It's a marvel how things run like clockwork! </p>
                                        <p>Our Verdict is to opt for this one-of-a-kind pass and not be pennywise and pound foolish, after all you are going on a holiday to drain out your stress, not create the hassles that come with not having such an essential document. </p>
                                        <p>The Swiss Travel pass is definitely worth every penny now more than ever as it comes in electronic format. </p>
                                        <p>This rids you of your tensions of losing such an essential document while travelling. </p>
                                        <p>There has never been an easier way to travel and once you experience Switzerland for what it really is, we are sure you'll not explore this country any other way. </p>

                                        <p>Spending 3 Days in Switzerland may not be enough, but if that’s all one has, it would be wise to make the best of it. So follow this power-packed <a href="/blog/switzerland-itinerary-3-days" class="lnks" target="_blank">3 days Switzerland itinerary</a> and see your vacation stretch farther than you could imagine.</p>
                                        <p>Luckily Switzerland’s small size allows you to cover a lot of it even with a minimal time frame. And the amazing <a href="/swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Switzerland Train Pass</a> that has a 3-day version ties in perfectly with this.</p>
                                        <p>This itinerary is done with staying in Lucerne and moving around from there so that there is no time wasted in check in-check outs whilst transiting from place to place.</p>

                                        <p>Now let’s see in detail what to do with our 3 days in Switzerland.</p>
                                        <h2 class="bdm-title">Day 1: Lucerne - Mt Titlis, City Tour, Lake Lucerne</h2>
                                        <div class="bdm-placeCard">
                                            <div class="bdm-placeCard-image">
                                                <img src="/images/blog/switzerland-itinerary-3-days-boat-ride-lake-lucerne-swiss-itinerary.jpg" alt="boat ride lake lucerne swiss itinerary" />
                                            </div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>Arrive early morning into Zurich or Basel and head straight for Lucerne. Your transfer will barely take you 60 to 90 minutes. Check in to your Lucerne apartment or hotel, freshen up and head back out.</p>
                                        <p>Today, you visit one of the many mountains that surround Lucerne. You can choose from Mount Pilatus, Mt. Titlis, Mount Rigi or the Stanserhorn. I prefer Mount Titlis here since it is the most popular and also my favourite.</p>
                                        <p>To get to Mount Titlis, you need to travel to Engelberg (45 minutes by train from Lucerne) so make sure you have your Swiss Travel Pass handy.</p>
                                        <p>Next, you need to have purchased the excursion ticket (which comes at a discounted price with the Swiss Travel Pass). Again, it’s a good idea to have bought your <a href="/mountain-excursion/5-mount-titlis" class="lnks" target="_blank">Mount Titlis ticket</a> in advance.</p>
                                        <p>On arrival at Engelberg, take a leisurely 10-minute walk to the Titlis valley station (some buses depart from just outside the station). Once you have your tickets exchanged, you will take the first gondola, the Titlis Xpress, from the base station to Trubsee and on to Stand.</p>
                                        <p>Then change over to the next gondola Titlis Rotair - The rotating cable car - which will give you a 360-degree view of the Alps as you make your way to the peak. </p>
                                        <p>Mount Titlis is a fun mountain and has snow throughout the year. Once on top, enjoy the Cliff walk (you get to walk on the highest suspension bridge in Europe!), Ice Flyer chair lift and Glacier Park.</p>
                                        <p>For adventure lovers, there are also various activities, including a zipline at Trubsee. </p>
                                        <p>If the activities have had you build up an appetite, head for one of the many restaurants. There is a choice of restaurants with different cuisines (even an Indian menu that includes tea).</p>
                                        <p>Once you have had your fill of the mountain, head down and make your way back to Lucerne.</p>
                                        <p>Some of the main sights of Lucerne are located close to the station. You can start your walking exploration of Lucerne from here.</p>
                                        <p>The Chapel Bridge (Kapellbrücke) - A symbol of Lucerne city and the oldest wooden pedestrian bridge is visible from the station itself.</p>
                                        <p>The bridge has several paintings under the roof. A part of it also has the Water Tower (Wasserturm) standing 34 meters in height.</p>
                                        <p>The Lion Monument (Löwendenkmal), another symbol of Lucerne, is a dying lion carved out of sandstone rock in memory and honour of the Swiss soldiers.</p>
                                        <p>A small glacier garden is located nearby. Then, time permitting, make your way to the Clock tower (Zytturm), the city’s oldest colourful clock or walk towards the pier to take a cruise on Lake Lucerne.</p>
                                        <p>You can either take one of the public boats (one of the free <a href="/blog/10-ultimate-benefits-of-swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Rail Pass benefits</a>) or take a Dinner Cruise on Lake Lucerne and enjoy the scenery as you have a sumptuous meal.</p>
                                        <p>After you enjoy the views on this cruise, it’s time to head back to your accommodation, marking the end of the first day of your 3 days <a href="/blog/switzerland-itinerary-8-days" class="lnks" target="_blank">Switzerland itinerary</a>.</p>
                                        <strong>Tips:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li style='margin-left: 15px;'>1.	The city tour will take about one and a half hour.</li>
                                            <li style='margin-left: 15px;'>2.	The dinner cruises depart at 7 pm, so plan accordingly.</li>
                                            <li style='margin-left: 15px;'>3.	Both Zurich and Lucerne stations have several stores, eating outlets and grocery stores, so you can always have a meal or pick up some groceries from there.</li>

                                        <p>Head to Interlaken this morning. A significant part of the day will be spent visiting the Jungfrau, popularly known as "The Top Of Europe".</p>
                                        <p>Interlaken lies between Lake Thun and Lake Brienz and is the perfect combination of lakes and mountains. Other than the mountain excursions, Interlaken is also a hub of adventure sports. If you are interested in paragliding, sky diving, white water rafting or kayaking, it would be best to make your bookings in advance, though.</p>
                                        <p>The journey from Lucerne to Interlaken OST station is approximately 2 hours by train so ensure you have an early start.</p>
                                        <p>The journey to Europe’s highest railway station at an altitude of 3454 metres used to be entirely by train. However, effective the end of 2020, Jungfrau has also introduced the Eiger Express. This brand new cable car route takes you part of the way and effectively cuts down travel time to the top.</p>
                                        <p>Train buffs can still continue to travel the old train route if they wish. If you have purchased your <a href="/mountain-excursion/1-jungfraujoch-top-of-europe" class="lnks" target="_blank">Jungfrau tickets</a> in advance, all you have to do is exchange your voucher at Interlaken OST station (Jungfrau counter) and proceed towards the first leg of the journey from Interlaken OST</p>
                                        <p>If you have opted for the train route (2 hours), you will make the journey to the top via 2 changes - Lauterbrunnen and Kleine Scheidegg. The way gives some spectacular views of the glaciers and the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau.</p>
                                        <p>The train also makes a few stops for you to get off and enjoy the sights and acclimatize yourself to the rarer air as you ascend higher.</p>
                                        <p>If you choose the new Eiger Express cable car route, you can take the train from Interlaken to Grindelwald, then the cable car from Grindelwald to the Eiger Glacier Station and lastly the train to the peak.</p>
                                        <p>This route has cut down the journey time by a significant 47 minutes (I don’t think the Swiss would like anyone rounding up the times and saying close to 50 minutes)!</p>
                                        <p>Once you arrive on top, walk to the iconic Sphinx, which contains restaurants, souvenir stores, the ice palace, and Lindt chocolate heaven.</p>
                                        <p>You will also have access to the viewing platforms from where you can see the Aletsch Glacier- the longest glacier in the Alps. Try a few snow activities and then proceed to one of the restaurants for lunch (there is self-service, fine dining and even an Indian restaurant).</p>
                                        <p>Making your descent after lunch will give you some time to explore the town of Interlaken. Take a walk along the famous Hoheweg promenade, a street filled with cafes, hotels, stores and the Interlaken Casino. For Bollywood fans, this Casino’s garden has a bronze statue of Yash Chopra too. Make your way back to Lucerne.</p>

                                        <strong>Tips:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">1.	You can either stop at Grindelwald and explore the town or else stop in Lauterbrunnen and visit the famous Trummelbach Falls on the descent from Jungfrau.</li>
                                            <li style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">2.	The train journey between Interlaken - Lucerne or vice versa is on the Lucerne Interlaken Express panoramic train, a part of the Golden Pass Line. Reservation is not compulsory on this route. The Swiss Pass takes care of it.</li>
                                            <li style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">3.	Leave Lucerne no later than 8 am to make the best of this day.</li>
                                            <li style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">4.	If you have the Swiss Pass, you can avail yourself of the Jungfrau ticket price. On its own, Jungfrau is one of the more expensive mountains.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                            Make your way to Zurich (1 hour) for a day in the city.
                                You can cover the city with your Swiss Travel Pass. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Start with Bahnhofstrasse – a very popular street in Zurich flanked by boutiques, coffee shops, stores that sell jewellery, watches, chocolates, and many big brands. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            This is “The shopper’s paradise”. From there, walk towards the Old Town. On your way, you will see Zurich’s landmarks – The Fraumunster Church, Zurich Lake (Limmat) and the Grossmunster. You can also cover one of the points that offer views of the city from an elevation. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Lindenhof hill offers breathtaking views of the Old Town, the lake, the churches, and the city hall. And serves as a public park and picnic spot (They have GIANT chess sets here). 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Alternatively, go to Üetliberg, a small mountain that offers Zurich's panoramic views, the lake, and the alps from the top. It’s a short train ride from the central station and a steep walk to the top. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Next, head for the Rhine falls, which is easily accessible by train. </p>

                                        <p>
                                            You can take the train to Neuhausen or Schloss Laufen and then follow the signboard and walk to the Rhine Falls. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            If you are visiting in summer, try a boat ride to the centre of the waterfalls (at a nominal cost). 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Since Zurich is a big city, you can also opt for a <a href="/Sightseeings" class="lnks" target="_blank">guided city tour</a> to make the most of the limited time. Some tours range from 2-hour city tour to almost 8 hours (combining city tours with the Rhine Falls or the medieval village of Stein Am Rhein). 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            These day tours are top-rated and best purchased in advance. Some of these tours even drop you at the airport on completion. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            You may think this seems like a lot to do in 3 days <a href="/switzerland-tour-packages" class="lnks" target="_blank">Switzerland package</a>. Still, the public transport system of Switzerland is just so easy to use. Of course, it works with Swiss precision, so if you have a well-planned itinerary, you will cover everything suggested here with ease and comfort. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>So get ready for a power-packed 3 days in this beautiful country and return with memories of a lifetime!</p>
                                        <strong>General tips:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">1.	Always check the last train back to the city you’re staying at. This way, you won’t miss your connection and will also make it a point to rule out things you’re not interested in. </li>
                                            <li style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">2.	If you’ve decided to stay at an apartment, remember to stock up some groceries or eatables for the rest of your trip from the nearest supermarket on Day 1. That way you will not waste time doing some shopping each day.</li>
                                            <li style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">3.	If you think heights will make you light-headed or dizzy, chew on some sour sweets on the way up to the mountains.</li>
                                            <li style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">4.	If you have missed out on your shopping, make sure to reach the airport early. Zurich airport shopping centre and its duty-free shops offer a fantastic choice of retail outlets for clothes, accessories, apparels, chocolates, cheeses and of course, watches.</li>
                                            <li style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">5.	Carry a water bottle with you. There is no need to purchase water in Switzerland. Every town has water fountains from where you can fill up on super clean alpine water. </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                        <p>Your first destination in this <strong>9-day itinerary</strong> is Montreux. Your point of arrival in Switzerland should be via Geneva, as it is the closest airport to Montreux. However, if you're flying into Zurich as your entry point, you still have good train connections to Montreux. It would take approximately between 1.30 hours from Geneva Airport or 2.50 hours from Zurich Airport. Don't forget to keep your Swiss Travel Pass and passport in hand before you board your train. </p>

                                        <p>Montreux is located on the western side of Switzerland and is also a part of the Lake Geneva region. You will experience this when your train arrives closer to Montreux, and you pass by villages and vineyards located around the lakes. </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Make your way to the hotel, freshen up and relax. After lunch, proceed to Château de Chillon. The Chillon Castle is a fortress on a rocky island and houses many medieval frescoes and dungeons. There are various rooms at multiple levels and interconnected pathways with wooden staircases to explore within the castle. Some rooms have interactive areas, and some have great audios and videos, which makes it easier to understand the history behind the castle and make it come alive.
                                After you finish your visit to Chillon Castle, take the bus to Montreux promenade (towards the central station) and walk along the lakeside. You will come across huge parks, a boat pier, and many metal art sculptures on the way. You cannot miss out on Freddie Mercury's bronze statue here. Enjoy the sunset here with a light snack or a cup of coffee at one of the restaurants nearby.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Make your way back to your hotel or <a href="/apartments" class="lnks" target="_blank">apartment</a> overnight in Montreux. </p>
                                        <p><strong>Note: </strong>A proper lunch/dinner in the Montreux region could be pretty expensive, so it's best to buy smaller meals or snacks from the grocery store.</p>

                                            Today you will take a train to Gstaad, which is around 1.30 hours away. If you've ever come across posters/photographs of Switzerland, they have most probably been shot here.
                                Once you move out of Gstaad station, you will find yellow buses parked outside.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Take the one which reads Les Diablerets , and get off at Col-du-Pillon, which is the base station for the <a href="/mountain-excursion/4-glacier-3000" class="lnks" target="_blank">Glacier 3000</a>. Exchange your mountain voucher at the base station and proceed towards the cable car up. After changing a cable car at a midway point, you will reach the peak. </p>

                                        <p>The highlight here is the "Tissot Peak walk", a suspension bridge that connects two mountains (Included in your mountain voucher). You get a great view of the Alps from here. The Alpine coaster - the highest bobsleigh track and many other activities like the Snow Bus, Dog Sled rides are available at an additional cost (Operation depends on weather conditions). </p>

                                        <p>Have lunch at one of the restaurants on top and take the cable car back down. Make sure you check restaurant timings as soon as you're on top, so that you walk in for lunch much before they close for the day. You can take a stroll around the village of Gstaad, look at cows grazing over the meadows, an alpine experience for all ages. Take the train back to Montreux. Overnight in Montreux. </p>

Visit the Matterhorn Museum and stop by at the church of St Mauritius too. A lot of picture-perfect locations with the Matterhorn in the background.</p>

A leisurely walk to the base station of <a href="/mountain-excursion/7-matterhorn-glacier-paradise" class="lnks" target="_blank">Matterhorn Glacier Paradise</a> will take about 15 mins from the main station. The triangular peak of the Matterhorn is the inspiration behind the unique shape of the Toblerone chocolate. Once you reach the base station, you take the 3- stage gondola ride to the peak. </p>

                                        <p>Try the "Crystal ride" cabins, decorated with Swarovski crystals, and a transparent floor, which gives you a view of the glaciers below. This is only available for a small leg of the journey and is at an additional cost, but is worth it. </p>

                                        <p>After a 50-minute gondola ride, you will be at the highest cable car station in Europe, at the height of 3883 meters.

Depending on your time and interest, you could choose to do either of the options below, all accessible with the Swiss Travel Pass.</p>

                                        <p>
                                            1.	A basic <strong>city tour</strong> can be done on your own using the Switzerland train pass. You can start with Bahnhofstrasse - a trendy street in Zurich flanked by boutiques, coffee shops, stores that sell jewelry, watches, chocolates, and a lot of big brands too. From there, you can walk towards the old town.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            On your way, you will see Zurich's landmarks - The Fraumunster Church, Zurich Lake (Limmat) and the Grossmunster. If you're willing to walk a little more to an elevated area, you can visit the Lindenhof hill, which offers breathtaking views of the old town, the lake, the churches, city hall etc. This spot also serves as a public park and picnic spot.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>2.	You can go to <strong>Üetliberg, </strong>a small mountain that offers Zurich's panoramic views, the lake, and the Alps from the top. It's a short train ride from the main station and a steep walk to the top.</p>

                                        <p>3.	You can also visit the <strong>Rhine Falls,</strong> which is easily accessible by train. You can take the train to Neuhausen or Schloss Laufen and then follow the signboard and walk to the Rhine Falls. A boat ride in the centre of the waterfalls is possible at an additional cost.</p>
                                        <p>If you do not want to cover the city on your own, you can opt for seat- in- coach tours too. However, this depends on what time you arrive in Zurich as the tours have fixed timings and have to be booked in advance. Also, check out <a href="/blog/things-to-do-in-zurich" class="lnks" target="_blank">10 things to do in Zurich</a>, penned by Swiss travel experts. </p>


                                        <p>Have dinner at the nearest restaurant (If you're at the airport, try the food court there) and move to your hotel. Overnight at Zurich. </p>

                                        <p>Europe is a vast continent and very well connected by its modern and efficient public transport. Most travelers including myself would want to cover multiple countries and keep the best-connected ones in mind.</p>
                                        <p>Switzerland with its perfect location will invariably feature in this.The following <a href="/blog/switzerland-itinerary-5-days" class="lnks" target="_blank">5 days Switzerland itinerary</a>  was a part of our longer tour to Europe covering Paris, Switzerland and Austria.</p>
                                        <p>What strikes you as soon as you reach Switzerland is the ease of travelling around it.No other country has as integrated a public transport system as Switzerland.And certainly no other country has a transport pass that allows you to just use all kinds of transport.</p>
                                        <p>We’d purchased our  <a href="/swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Rail Pass.</a> in advance;so we could just get on our first train on arrival from Paris to Basel.Trying to maximize a 5 day stay in Switzerland while basing ourselves in one place (we rented a short stay apartment in Lucrne), was largely possible due to the pass and the <a href="/blog/10-ultimate-benefits-of-swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">benefits of the Swiss Travel Pass.</a></p>
                                        <p>Here’s what we did and what you can do with your 5 days in Switzerland.</p>

                                        <p>Whether entering Switzerland by air,rail or cruise,you will most likely arrive into Zurich or Basel.From here, head straight to Lucerne (1 hour),which is generally well connected with direct trains.</p>
                                        <p>Lucerne is a popular tourist town with plenty of accommodation options from budget to luxury hotels and <a href="/apartments" class="lnks" target="_blank">apartments in Switzerland.</a></p>
                                        <p>It would be best to take it easy on the first day after a long day of travel so you could just head out to cover the main sights of this lakeside town</p>
                                        <p>Nothing like starting with Lucerne’s most striking Chapel bridge – a wooden covered bridge which has come to be a symbol of the town.</p>
                                        <p>Continue along the cobbled stone streets to make your way to the Lion Monument – a massive and poignant figure of a dying lion carved out of a sandstone rock ledge.</p>
                                        <p>The Old town of Lucerne should be the next stop. Walk along this fairytale-like area with its timber framed buildings and Lucerne’s oldest church St. Peter’s chapel.</p>
                                        <p>The north end of the Old Town has the striking Musegg wall with its 9 different looking towers.Four of these towers are open to the public.If you are ready for a climb, you will be rewarded with an amazing view over the town.</p>
                                        <p>Pro Tip: On your way back to the hotel,make sure to visit some of the famous local chocolatiers.The most tempting window displays of chocolates just tempt you to walk in and try.</p>
                                        <p>Remember that the Swiss Travel Pass will allow you to just hop on to a bus to take you from place to place in case you are tired and don’t wish to walk.</p>
                                        <p>Time to rest well on your first of the 5 days in Switzerland!</p>

                                        <p>The best way to cover a mountain is to dedicate a full day to it. Today head to one of the most famous mountains of Switzerland – <a href="/mountain-excursion/5-mount-titlis" class="lnks" target="_blank">5-mount-titlis</a></p>
                                        <p>Take a train from Lucerne train station to Engelberg (45 minutes) a beautiful Swiss village located at the base of Mount Titlis.</p>
                                        <p>From here either walk for 15 minutes to the cable car valley station for Titlis or opt for a bus from just outside the station.The journey to the top is done by 2 cable cars. First, the Titlis Xpress, and then the Titlis Rotair – a Rotating Cable car that gives a spectacular 360-degree view of the surrounding Alpine landscape.</p>
                                        <p>There are tons of activities that can be enjoyed here. Some like the Ice Flyer, the Ice cave and the famous Titlis Cliff Walk are at the peak.But there are also lots of things including a zipline that you can do at the midway point in Trubsee.</p>
                                        <p>After your descent from Titlis,take some time to wander around Engelberg town and also visit he Benedictine Monastery there.We did not have the time for it,but the monastery also has a small cheese making unit where you can see how the local cheese is produced.</p>
                                        <p>Return back to Lucerne to mark an end of the second day of 5 days  <a href="/blog/switzerland-itinerary-8-days" class="lnks" target="_blank">Switzerland itinerary.</a></p>

                                        <h3>Alternative Day 2 Itinerary</h3>
                                        <p>Lucerne is famous for its museums and none more so than the<a href="/mountain-excursion/35-swiss-transport-museum" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Museum of Transport</a>.Don’t let the name fool you,it’s an amazing place for adults and kids alike and other than the history of transport,it has a huge arena where kids can enjoy, a planetarium and the interactive 	Swiss Chocolate Adventure. People, particularly travelling with kids, always include it in their <a href="/switzerland-tour-packages" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss package.</a></p>
                                        <p>The Swiss Museum of Transport is partly open-air so please check weather beforehand.</p>
                                        <p>Other mountains near Lucerne: Lucerne is home to other mountains like the Mount Pilatus, Mt. Rigi and Mt. Stanserhorn. Some of these are also totally free with the Swiss Travel Pass.We chose to do Mt Titlis because it is snowbound throughout the year and we wanted to experience the rotating cable car</p>
                                        <p>Pro tip: If you’d like to explore more in this town, read our dedicated blog on <a href="/blog/10-things-to-do-in-lucerne-switzerland" class="lnks" target="_blank">things to do in Lucerne.</a></p>

                                        <div class="bdm-placeCard">

                                        <p>Switzerland is all about heights and superlatives.Get ready to visit the Jungfraujoch – The top of Europe and the highest train station in Europe! Make an early start from Lucerne (latest by 8am) and hop on to the Lucerne – Interlaken Express scenic train to reach Interlaken.</p>
                                        <p>From here one can opt for the old and traditional route with 2 train changes to the top or the new Eiger route that is partly by cableway.</p>
                                        <h3>Route 1</h3>
                                        <p>Once you exchange tickets for Jungfrau at the Interlaken Ost Jungfrau counter head to Lauterbrunnen by train.Change trains at Lauterbrunnen and proceed to Kleine Scheidegg from where you travel on the final journey to the peak.</p>
                                        <p>The route is very scenic and on the last journey the train stops a couple of times for people to get off for a few minutes and enjoy the scenery.These stops also help to acclimatize yourself to the thinner air as you ascend.This traditional route takes 2 hours</p>
                                        <h3>Route 2</h3>
                                        <p>Take the train to Grindelwald,then a cable car to Eiger Glacier Station and lastly the train to Jungfrau.A person saves roughly 45 minutes on this route.</p>
                                        <p>At the top of Jungfrau, make your way outdoors into the snow, enjoy sweeping views of the Aletsch Glacier- the longest in the alps,walk into the eerily blue Ice Palace with various ice sculptures and visit the Lindt Chocolate Heaven.</p>
                                        <p>If you have made an early start to the day,you will be able to visit the beautiful town of Interlaken and spend some time on its Hoheweg (main street) before you head back to Lucerne.</p>
                                        <p>Pro Tip: As it’s one of the most expensive mountains in Switzerland,buy <a href="/mountain-excursion/1-jungfraujoch-top-of-europe" class="lnks" target="_blank">Jungfraujoch tickets with Swiss Pass</a> Jungfraujoch tickets with Swiss Pass to avail a discounted price and free entry for your kids.</p>

                                        <p>Staying in a well-connected place like Lucerne gives you the advantage of doing day trips to almost every place in the country.We had to decide between Zermatt, Basel and Montreux.</p>
                                        <p>In our Switzerland itinerary for 5 days, we decided on Zermatt simply because we could not imagine going to Switzerland and skipping the Matterhorn – the most famous of all mountains!</p>
                                        <p>This choice made it a very long day, but it was worth it.</p>
                                        <p>Zermatt is reached via 2 train changes and a travel time of just over 3 hours.This alpine village is car free – one has to get around by electric buses or horse drawn carriages!</p>
                                        <p>On arrival into Zermatt, you can take a leisurely walk through the center of town to reach the valley station of the<a href="/mountain-excursion/7-matterhorn-glacier-paradise" class="lnks" target="_blank"> Matterhorn Glacier Paradise.</a>The Matterhorn is said to be the most photographed mountain in the world (remember this country is all about superlatives).</p>
                                        <p>If you have had your share of Swiss chocolates by now, you will have figured out the connection between the unique shape of the Toblerone chocolate and the almost geometrically-perfect peak of the Matterhorn.</p>

                                        <p>Once on top you get brilliant views of the alps and on a clear day can see as far as the Mont Blanc in France.</p>
                                        <p>If you have some time on the return back to town,the Matterhorn Museum and the historical Hinterdorf area of Zermatt are worth visiting too</p>
                                        <p>In case, you decide to go to Montreux or Gstaad instead of Zermatt,here is what you can do.</p>
                                        <h3>Lucerne to Montreux and Gstaad</h3>
                                        <p>Leave early morning and head to Gstaad roughly 3 hrs 45 minutes.Gstaad is one of the most expensive and beautiful villages in Switzerland.The rolling hills,green mountains and snowcapped peaks make it a place frequented by the rich and the famous who decide to descend onto the town for their annual vacations.</p>

                                        <p>The village is so small that a walk along the central pedestrian area takes you from one end to the other in just a few minutes!</p>
                                        <p>From Gstaad proceed by train to Montreux, a beautiful village on the shores of Lake Geneva surrounded by beautiful Swiss Alps.</p>
                                        <p>One can walk alongside the lake, visit the statue of Freddie Mercury or visit the Chillon Castle. Later proceed back to Lucerne in the evening.</p>

                                        <h2 class="bdm-title">Day 5: Lucerne to Zurich and Rhine Falls</h2>
                                        <p>Today is the day you end your <a href="/switzerland-tour-packages" class="lnks" target="_blank">Switzerland tour</a> so the activities mentioned below will largely be dependent on your departure time.</p>
                                        <p>Depart Lucerne for Zurich Airport or Zurich Main Train Station (direct train and time taken roughly 1 hr 15 mins).At Zurich Airport you can deposit your bags at the baggage counter and proceed to Rhine Falls.</p>
                                        <p>Take the train to Neuhausen Rheinfall or the Schloss Laufen train station and make your way on foot to the falls</p>
                                        <p>There is a lift that takes you to an up-close viewing point from where you can actually feel the thunder and spray of the falls.</p>
                                        <p>You can also take a boat ride that takes you up close to the falls.The lift and the boat ride come at nominal costs that range between 5 to 10 Swiss francs.</p>

                                        <p>On return to Zurich,get out of the main entrance of the station and continue walking down Bahnhofstrasse (main street) and walk past the outlets of every major watch and jewelry brand.Now’s your chance to splurge and indulge yourself.</p>
                                        <p>The end of Bahnhofstrasse will lead you to the lakeside and a good view of Zurich City.</p>
                                        <p>On the way back, you can choose to walk through Zurich old town.</p>
                                        <p>If you are departing by flight,collect your luggage from the lockers and make your way to the airport.</p>
                                        <p>If you have the full day in Zurich, it would be wise to opt for a <a href="/Sightseeings" class="lnks" target="_blank">guided sightseeing</a> by coach.There are various city tours to choose from.The ones that cover the city along with the Rhine Falls or the Black Forest area are a good choice.</p>
                                        <p>Doing all of this may seem a bit intimidating but it was all possible in a short span because we had the Swiss Travel Pass and had also pre-purchased some of the mountains (of course at the relevant<a href="/blog/top-discounts-on-swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank"> discounts with Swiss Pass).</a></p>
                                        <p>You could also choose to move from town to town instead of making a base in one place. Our decision to stay in one place was based on cost (we found a relatively inexpensive apartment) and not wanting to waste time in check-in-check-out procedures</p>
                                        <p>When it comes to spending 5 days in Switzerland, one really does not have to think long and hard. Just start packing and let the country work its magic on you.</p>

                                        <p>Having arrived at Geneva airport early morning at 6:00 am, we decided to see the city before heading to Zermatt.Depositing the bags and freshening up at the airport, we started our tour with the help of our <a href="/swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Travel Pass</a>,which we had luckily pre-purchased.</p>
                                        <p>One must most certainly look at the Swiss Travel Pass as it offers various discounts and benefits and free access to all public transport in the whole of Switzerland.Also,kids under 16 years travel free when their parents hold the pass.</p>
                                        <p>Our first halt was at the UN Headquarters (30 minutes from Geneva airport). Since we knew exactly what we wanted to cover in the day,we had pre-booked a guided tour on their website. That was clearly a good decision.</p>
                                        <p>The next halt was at the CERN (40 minutes), one of the most respected Scientific research centres in the world, is known for its LHC (Large Hadron Collider) experiment.They offer free guided tours that are really interesting.</p>
                                        <p>Last halt - Lake Geneva (35 minutes). Unfortunately,we did not have time to do a cruise, but ideally that would have been perfect.We spent some time along the promenade and had to make do with a long-distance view of the amazing Jet d’Eau, but the day in Geneva was worth it.</p>
                                        <p>We had to return to the airport, collect our bags and head off to Zermatt</p>
                                        <p>Travel time Geneva airport to Zermatt:3.55 hours with one change at Visp.</p>
                                        <p>We had booked an <a href="/apartments" class="lnks" target="_blank">apartment in Switzerland</a>; so we picked up some food along the way to it and decided to call it a night.</p>
                                        <span>Travel tip:</span>
                                        <p>Zermatt is car-free, so try and book a hotel or apartment that offers a pick up from the station (our apartment offered this as a complimentary service but some charge a nominal fee)</p>
                                        <p>If you can stretch your accommodation budget, please do it here. Nothing can compare to waking up to a view of the Matterhorn.</p>

                                        <p>We had heard so much about aiming for the best views of the Matterhorn that we decided to go to two of the famous viewing points. The first was the <a href="/mountain-excursion/7-matterhorn-glacier-paradise" class="lnks" target="_blank">Matterhorn Glacier Paradise.</a></p>
                                        <p>Of course, another major reason to choose this was the snow.The Matterhorn Glacier Paradise promises snow all year round. </p>
                                        <p>A walk through the centre of the village had us passing by stores,souvenir shops and cafes with their fresh croissants and intoxicating smell of coffee. </p>
                                        <p>We had booked our excursion tickets in advance at the <a href="/blog/top-discounts-on-swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">discount with Swiss Travel Pass.</a></p>
                                        <p>We changed 2 cable cars before we reached the peak via some glorious views.In hindsight, it would have been nice to try one of the Swarovski Crystal cable cars have transparent floors that allow you to get a vertical view as you go higher. </p>
                                        <p>On top,we felt enveloped by the snow. After some time of being in the outdoors and clicking photos,we headed to the Glacier Palace.This is literally 15 metres below the glacier's surface and has some ice sculptures, and an ice toboggan run.A quick lunch at the restaurant, and we were ready to leave. </p>
                                        <p>Once back down,we walked into Zermatt’s Old Town (Hinterdorf, which literally means rear village) and decided to head to <a href="/mountain-excursion/25-Sunnegga" class="lnks" target="_blank">Sunnegga</a>,our next scenic viewing spot for the Matterhorn and the surrounding mountains. </p>
                                        <p>The Sunnegga-Rothorn valley station is a comfortable 10-minute walk away from Zermatt train station. </p>
                                        <p>Just hop on to the funicular that takes you to the top in under 5 minutes.There is a Wolli Adventure park by the lake where kids can cool off and have some fun for families with little kids.</p>
                                        <p>Of course,the main reason to be here was the view of the Matterhorn,and we were truly rewarded with that! </p>
                                        <p>A perfect way to end the second day of our 6 days in Switzerland. </p>

                                        <p>A hugely popular Swiss town for tourists and a base for many sightseeing options and activities – this is Interlaken.</p>
                                        <p>A 2.30-hour train journey with 2 changes brought us into Interlaken by lunchtime.We had the option of taking an apartment but decided to go with a hotel to cover breakfast.There are a lot of hotels close to both Interlaken East and West stations.</p>
                                        <p>Not knowing how much we could cover on this day,we had only booked a <a href="/mountain-excursion/19-jetboat-interlaken" class="lnks" target="_blank">jetboat in Interlaken ride.</a></p>
                                        <p>We were picked up from our hotel and taken to the jetty.All geared up with life jackets, we were ready for our ride along with another few passengers in the same boat. </p>
                                        <p>Zooming at high speed with 360-degree spins in the shimmering lake surrounded by stunning green mountains was really an experience.Later, we headed back to Interlaken and spent the evening in town walking around the main street – Hoheweg.</p>
                                        <p>However,if you wish and have enough energy left,you can ascend to <a href="/mountain-excursion/2-harder-kulm" class="lnks" target="_blank">Harder Kulm</a> to indulge in one of the most breathtaking views of Interlaken from atop.A funicular railway that’s more than 100 years old takes you on the cliff at 1322 m above sea level.</p>
                                        <p>On top,bask in the astounding view of Interlaken and Switzerland's three most popular mountains – Eiger,Monch,andJungfraujoch.Many people include Harder Kulm in their <a href="/switzerland-tour-packages" class="lnks" target="_blank">Switzerland tour package</a> as it doesn’t take much time.</p>
                                        <p>That pretty much will sum up your itinerary on day 4.</p>

                                            <div class="bdm-placeCard-image">

                                        <p>One of the main reasons for the popularity of Interlaken is the Jungfrau. A visit to Jungfraujoch starts from Interlaken Ost station. When we visited, there was just one route to follow. But as of the end of 2020, there is a new route which takes you by cable car part of the way. One can now choose from one of the 2 routes to the top of <a href="/mountain-excursion/1-jungfraujoch-top-of-europe" class="lnks" target="_blank">Jungfrau - Top of Europe.</a>This is the highest train station in Europe! </p>
                                        <h3>Route 1 – The original route. Train only</h3>
                                        <p>We exchanged our Jungfrau tickets at the counter at Interlaken Ost station and started our journey. With 2 train changes at Lauterbrunnen and Kleine Scheidegg, we were at the peak station in roughly 2.10 hours. </p>
                                        <p>The route is very scenic, and on the last journey, the train stops a couple of times for people to get off for a few minutes and enjoy the views of the glacier, take photos and also get acclimatized to the height. </p>
                                        <h3>Route 2 – The new route. Train and Cableway</h3>
                                        <p>This route goes from Interlaken Ost to Grindelwald by train, then by cable car to the new Eigergletscher station and then again by train to the peak.  A person saves roughly 40 to 50 minutes on this route. Hopefully, we will do this the next time we are in Switzerland</p>
                                        <p>Jungfrau is snowbound throughout the year. So, we decided to have some fun in the snow and then went to see the Ice Palace and have a bite at one of the restaurants. Before leaving, we went to the Lindt Chocolate Heaven, and no one can be faulted for going overboard. </p>
                                        <p>On the way back down, we had a choice of visiting Grindelwald or the Trummelbach Falls from Interlaken. We decided on the latter since we had heard so much about these glacial waterfalls. </p>
                                        <p>On reaching Lauterbrunnen, we took a bus which takes you close to the falls. There is a lift that transports you up into the mountain, and from there, there is a series of steps and pathways that allow you to get different views of the chilly falls. These falls are actually caused by the melting waters of the Jungfrau, Eiger and Monch mountains. There is a nominal fee to enter, but we were delighted we visited. </p>
                                        <p>This day was the best day in our 6 days <a href="/blog/switzerland-itinerary-8-days" class="lnks" target="_blank">Switzerland itinerary.</a></p>

                                        <p>The Aletsch Glacier is the largest in Europe. To get a great view of this sea of ice, we visited the <a href="/mountain-excursion/36-aletsch-arena" class="lnks" target="_blank">Aletsch Arena.</a></p>
                                        <p>A train ride of 1.30 hours transported us to the Betten valley-station. From there, we took the cable car to the car-free village of Bettmeralp. After a short exploration of the village with its lovely chapel and lake, we continued by gondola to the Bettmerhorn. </p>
                                        <p>At the peak, there is a viewing platform from where you get stunning views. The Aletsch Glacier is 23 kms long, listed under the UNESCO World Heritage Site and holds around 11 billion tonnes of ice. </p>
                                        <p>With exhilarating views of 4000m peaks including Matterhorn, Jungfrau and Mont Blanc (Europe’s highest mountain, located in France) the Aletsch Arena was a real treat.There are a couple of other points from which you can reach the peak, but from Interlaken, we thought this was convenient. </p>
                                        <p>Depending on the season, there are various activities offered on top. Try your hand (or elgs) on a Glacier Walk, toboggan run, skiing, or even yoga. </p>
                                        <p>We spent some time in the interactive museum “Glacier World” at the Bettmerhorn. </p>
                                        <p>On our way back, we decided to stop by Brig for a quick tour of the town. Brig is home to the stunning Stockalper Palace and grounds. You can take guided tours to learn the history of this structure built between 1658 and 1678. </p>
                                        <p>And with that our second last day of 6 days in Switzerland came to an end. </p>

                                        <p>An early start by train got us into Zurich via Bern in 2 hours. We had an evening flight, so we pretty much had the full day to spend it visiting the Rhine Falls. </p>
                                        <p>After leaving our luggage at the lockers at the lower level of the Zurich main station, we took the train to Neuhausen Rheinfall station and then reached the falls. </p>
                                        <p>We walked along the falls and then took the lift,which takes you to a level from where you can really feel the thunder of the falls.There is a nominal fee of Swiss Francs 5 per person for the falls.</p>
                                        <p>You can also take a boat ride to the centre of the falls and climb up to its centre's huge rock formation.We decided to give this a skip.There are various boat ride options,and they cost between 10 to 15 Swiss francs. </p>
                                        <p>On return to Zurich, we collected our luggage and headed to the airport. We wanted to reach the airport early to do some shopping. </p>
                                        <p>Instead of buying things and carrying them around, we stock up at the huge Migros grocery at the airport just before boarding the flight. </p>
                                        <p>Zurich airport has a huge selection of outlets. All kinds of watches, jewellery, apparel, sports brands, chocolates and more are available. </p>
                                        <p>Well this brings us to the end of our 6 days Switzerland itinerary.</p>
                                        <p>While we agree that it may seem a bit fast-paced for some; we definitely tried to make the most of every minute that we had, and it was so worth it! </p>

                                            <li>-  Keep in mind that your best travel companion for Switzerland is the Swiss Travel Pass. Mountains, museums and all kinds of public transport are at your fingertips, thanks to this pass</li>
                                            <li>-     Mountains like the Matterhorn and Jungfrau are snow-clad all year round. Carrying a jacket, sturdy pair of shoes and goggles is wise. </li>
                                            <li>-    If you think that the thinner air at the peak may make you woozy or light-headed, chew on some sour sweets en route to the top. </li>
                                            <li>-   Switzerland is fairly small. If you think checking in and out of hotels and moving from place to place is not for you, you can even base your stay in just one central place, such as Interlaken or Lucerne, and cover the country from there.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>

                                            Most people wonder why a country as tiny as Switzerland can warrant a stay of more than a couple of days. However, once you figure out the wealth of things that this little country offers, even a 10-day trip will seem too short. Trust me, I have done multiple <a href="/switzerland-tour-packages" class="lnks" target="_blank">trips to Switzerland</a>, increasing the duration of my stay each time and highly recommend a <a href="/blog/switzerland-itinerary-10-days" class="lnks" target="_blank">10 days in Switzerland</a>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This paradise of a country offers so much from tiny traditional villages to big vibrant cities, pristine lakes and snow-capped mountains filled with adventure and fun. You may not be able to cover it all at one go, but you can definitely try to pack in the best of it in around 10 days. Let me start with a summary of my recommendation for this:
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            First things first; it would be best to arrive with a pre-purchased <a href="/swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Travel Pass</a> so that you can directly hop on to a train from the Zurich airport train station without having to wait in line to buy tickets or passes when all you want to do is head for your destination after a long flight.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Keep in mind that local travel in Switzerland is quite pricey. The pass covers all public transport, gives discounts on mountain trips, gives free entrance to museums, and is totally free for kids under 16!
                                        </p>

                                            Arrive in Zurich and hop on a train for Lucerne, which takes roughly 1.15 hours. Your day will depend on your arrival time in Lucerne. Here are some of the options for <a href="/blog/10-things-to-do-in-lucerne-switzerland" class="lnks" target="_blank">things to do in Lucerne today:</a>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Option 1: <a href="/mountain-excursion/35-swiss-transport-museum" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Transport Museum</a><br />
                                            Apart from showcasing the history of air, land, and even space transport, this open-air museum has a huge open arena where kids can try their hand at various activities. The complex also houses a planetarium, the country’s largest cinema screen, and the popular Swiss Chocolate Adventure. This is justifiably Switzerland’s most visited museum. The museum is partly open-air, so it would be wise to check the weather before heading there. It's a really fun family place where you can easily spend way over half a day.<br />
                                            Note: Make sure to flash your Swiss Travel Pass to avail of the <a href="/blog/top-discounts-on-swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Travel Pass discount</a> on the entrance fees.
                                        </p>

                                            Option 2: Local City Tour<br />
                                            If you would rather take it slow today, you can set off for a walk around this lovely town at your own pace.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Start with crossing the Chapel Bridge, read the history of this city and indeed one of Switzerland’s most iconic attractions. Continue to the Old Town with its winding cobbled-stone streets, timber-framed houses, Old Town Hall,  14th-century clock tower and Lucerne's oldest church, St. Peter's Chapel. Continue to another iconic attraction -the famous Lion Monument. From here, you can make your way back along the lakeside promenade, stopping by one or more of the many local chocolatiers before going back to your hotel.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Option 3: Mount Pilatus<br />
                                            If you have almost the whole day in hand, visit one of the nearby mountains. <a href="/mountain-excursion/6-mount-pilatus" class="lnks" target="_blank">Mount Pilatus</a> would be a good choice. The Golden Round Trip offered on this mountain makes the travel as exciting as the peak.<br />
                                            Head to the Lucerne jetty (conveniently located opposite the main train station) and hop on the boat to Alpnachstad. (This journey is free as it is public transport and part of the Swiss Travel Pass.)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            At Alpnachstad, get off the boat, head to the cogwheel train (the steepest in the world), and proceed to Mount Pilatus. On the way back use the cable car down to Kriens and take the bus back to Lucerne. If you still have time upon your return, carry on with your exploration of this lakeside town.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Note: Like most mountains, Mount Pilatus offers a Swiss Travel Pass discount. However, you must make a minimally charged reservation if you are travelling on the cogwheel train, which runs between May and November.
                                        </p>

                                            You won't want to miss Mount Titlis while staying in Lucerne. To visit Mount Titlis, take a train from Lucerne train station to Engelberg (45 minutes), a beautiful little  Swiss village located at the base of Mount Titlis.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            From here, walk for 15 minutes or take a bus to the cable car valley station for Titlis. Start your journey by two cable cars (including the revolving cable car – Titlis Rotair) to reach the top with mesmerising views of the Swiss Alps.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            On top, enjoy various activities like the Ice Flyer Chairlift, the Ice Cave and the amazing Titlis Cliff Walk. Have lunch at one of the restaurants at the peak before your descent.<br />
                                            Try making it back to Engelberg with some time to spare so you can walk around the village before returning to Lucerne.

                                            After covering all or most of the attractions in Lucerne, you can move on to another amazing Swiss town. Get ready for Interlaken, home to the majestic <a href="/mountain-excursion/1-jungfraujoch-top-of-europe" class="lnks" target="_blank">Jungfraujoch -the top of Europe</a>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            To do this excursion today, it would be nice to depart Lucerne around 7 to 8 am and hop on to the famous Interlaken - Lucerne Express, which connects these two towns. The journey to Interlaken takes roughly 2 hours. Arrive, check in to your Interlaken hotel or apartment and get ready to head off to the top of Europe!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There are two ways to reach this mountain - the older traditional route or the new cable car route via Grindelwald.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Route 1<br />
                                            The traditional route takes around 2 hours and takes you from Interlaken Ost station to the peak via 2 changes in Lauterbrunnen and Kleine Scheidegg.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The route is very scenic, and on the last journey, the train stops a couple of times at viewing points that give breathtaking views of the glacier. These little photo stops also help you to get acclimatized to the rarer air as you ascend.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <u>Route 2</u><br />
                                            The new route (started in 2020) takes you from Interlaken Ost to Grindelwald by train. At Grindelwald, you switch to the cable car to reach the Eiger Glacier Station. Then again, switch to train to reach the peak. This route takes roughly 1.15 hours.
                                        </p>

                                            The Jungfrau excursion is one of the more expensive ones, so make sure you have your <a href="/blog/10-ultimate-benefits-of-swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Travel Pass</a> so that you get the almost 35% discount for pass holders.

                                            At the top, enjoy amazing views of the Aletsch Glacier, the longest in the Alps.<br />
                                            Enjoy the ice palace with its sculptures, experience snow fun in the snow park in the summer and give in to temptation at the Lindt Chocolate Heaven.

                                            On the way back down, you can stop at Grindelwald and visit this Alpine village or stop at Lauterbrunnen and visit another attraction of this region—the glacial Trummelbach Falls.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The falls can be reached by a 10-minute bus ride from Lauterbrunnen station.
	The Trummelbach falls are actually 10 thundering waterfalls inside the mountain and are reached via a lift.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Note: Kids under four are not allowed to visit the falls.

                                            The most idyllic pictures of Switzerland are likely shot in Gstaad. Going to Gstaad gives you one more opportunity to use your Swiss Travel Pass on a scenic train. The Golden Pass Line connecting these towns will get you into Gstaad in roughly 1.50 hours via some of the most picturesque terrain.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The beauty of Gstaad has lured the rich and famous to holiday there and also made many leave their homes to settle there permanently. The perfect little wooden chalets in a manicured setting remind you of a scene from a fairy tale.

                                            After exploring this town, you can proceed further by train to Montreux (1.35 hours), a beautiful village on the shores of Lake Geneva. Spend some time walking along the lakeside promenade, visit the statue of Freddie Mercury and the Chillon Castle. The castle is built on an outcrop on the shores of Lake Geneva and is the most visited historical building in Switzerland.

                                            The ride up is as beautiful as the view from below.  Spend some time getting the perfect photos, visit the ice palace, and have a hearty Swiss meal with a view before you head back down. If you are up for it, you can also continue on the new alpine crossing, which takes you all the way to Cervina in Italy! If you are celebrating a big day or feel like splurging, go all out and book a Swarovski car. Embellished with Swarovski crystals on the outside and a glass-bottomed floor, these cars can elevate your experience to new heights!

It offers some of the best ski slopes in the world, attracting leisure travellers and sports enthusiasts alike. With a beautiful lake, great spas, and exclusive hotels, this little town offers all the glitz and glamour one can wish for.

                                            The Glacier Express requires a mandatory seat reservation, and one of the <a href="/blog/10-ultimate-benefits-of-swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">benefits of Swiss Travel Pass</a> is that one can get these at special rates. Remember to book your seats well in advance as they tend to sell out soon. Other than the first and second class, this train also offers an <a href="/mountain-excursion/43-glacier-express" class="lnks" target="_blank">Excellence Class</a>, which offers all window seats, a multi-course meal, Swiss wines and more.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Note: Depending on the season, there are up to 3 Glacier Express departures in a day. The Glacier Express has a fully equipped restaurant, and meals can also be pre-booked.

                                            From a winter destination to one that has 300 days of sunshine a year…and that too on another scenic train!! Get ready for Mediterranean warmth as you board the Bernina Express, which will take you from St. Moritz to Lugano, passing through UNESCO World Heritage sites.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The Bernina Express journey combines a train and bus segment. The first leg, from St. Moritz to Tirano, takes 2 hours and 15 minutes by train. The next part is via bus. The bus journey from Tirano to Lugano takes 3 hours and gets you into Lugano at around 5:30 in the evening.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            For both segments, a compulsory reservation is required, and it should be made well in advance since seats sell out soon. Swiss Travel Pass holders get special rates.

                                            Note: While booking, pay attention to match the timings between train and bus connections.

                                            Venture into Italy today. Visit Lake Como, a picturesque and popular resort in Italy that can be reached via a direct train in just 45 minutes. Spend time walking around the lake, take a bus to Bellagio, known as the ‘Pearl of Lake Como’ or shop for silk, which this area is famous for. Return to Lugano in the evening.

                                            Note: You will need to purchase a train ticket to visit Como since the Swiss Travel Pass is not valid for this journey.

                                            Based on where you are ending your holiday, you can do one of the following today.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Option 1: - Zurich<br />
                                            Reach Zurich main station via a direct train (roughly 2 hours). If you have a late evening flight, you can leave your bags at the station and still make the most of this day by heading to the Rhine Falls - Europe’s largest falls, either on your own or via a guided tour. Take a boat ride to the centre of the falls or view it from one of the viewing points close enough to feel the spray and hear the thunder.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Alternatively, you can set off to explore the town on your own or hop on a guided tour, which will conveniently take you through all the best parts of this vibrant city.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Of course, if you have more time and are staying a couple of more nights, there are many other sights to see and things to do in Zurich.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Note: The Rhine Falls charges an entrance fee of roughly CHF 5 per person as it is a protected National Park. The boat ride will cost an additional CHF 8 to CHF 10 per person.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Option 2: - Milan<br />
                                            If you are departing from Milan airport, you will take a train to Malpensa airport (roughly 1.5 hours). You will have to purchase a train ticket since the Swiss Pass will not cover this journey.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Time permitting, you can get off at the main station and take a Hop-on-Hop-off bus tour to get a feel of the city.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Don’t forget your last-minute shopping. After all, you are in the fashion capital of the world!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As I said, Switzerland has so much to offer. The above are just some of the main things that one can do whilst maintaining a well-paced 10-day program. Hope you can include most or all of the above and more in your next  Swiss holiday program.

                                        <h3>Things to know:</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            The Swiss Travel Pass comes in versions of 3, 4, 8 and 15 days. There is also a continuous pass and a flex option, which allows you to travel the chosen number of days within a month (convenient for those staying in one place much longer than in others).<br />
                                            Switzerland is undoubtedly expensive when compared to the rest of Europe. To help with the budget, you can opt for <a href="/apartments" class="lnks" target="_blank">apartments in Switzerland</a> instead of hotels. Apartments can accommodate more people per unit and also have a kitchenette, which makes it comfortable to cook a few meals or have some grocery-bought meals instead of going to restaurants.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Restaurant meals can cost upwards of Swiss Francs 35 per person, whereas a quick pizza, McDonald's, or doner kebab meal can cost Swiss Francs 18-20.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The best souvenirs to purchase would be a Swiss army knife, cowbells, chocolates, cheeses and, if your budget permits, Swiss watches!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Never travel without a warm jacket, comfortable shoes, and sunglasses. Many mountains are snowbound throughout the year.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Even though the Swiss Franc is the official currency, the Euro is accepted everywhere. Remember that even if you pay a Euro, change is always returned in Swiss Francs.<br />
                                            Euro coins are not accepted in most places. However, a few shops at the airport do.
                                        </p>

Let us break down some of the awesome <a target="_blank" href="/blog/foods-and-drinks-to-try-in-switzerland" class='lnks'>Swiss dishes</a> that you absolutely have to try:</p>
                                        <p>
                                            <h3>● Fondue:</h3>
                                            Okay, so Fondue is like a magical pot of melted cheese mixed with wine and garlic. You grab some bread, potatoes, and veggies, dunk 'em into the gooey goodness, and voilà – you're officially doing Swiss Fondue like a pro.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <h3>● Raclette:</h3>
                                            Now, raclette is a bit of a cheese show. They melt the cheese and scrape it off this big wheel, serving it with veggies and potatoes. It's like a cheesy party in your mouth!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <h3>● Rösti:</h3>

                                            <h3>● Zürcher Geschnetzeltes:</h3>
                                            Okay, this one's a mouthful to say, but don't let that scare you. It's basically veal cooked up in a creamy mushroom sauce. They often serve it with spätzle (which is like tiny pasta) or more of that delicious rösti.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <h3>● Bündnerfleisch:</h3>
                                            And then there's Bündnerfleisch – the fancy name for air-dried beef. They usually slice it up and serve it with some bread and cheese. It's like the Swiss version of a tasty snack.
                                        </p>

                                            The last day of your Switzerland itinerary takes you back to Zürich, a bustling city with historical charm. You'll arrive in Zürich from St Moritz at night and begin your exploration of the city on the next (and final) day.
            Besides taking a day trip to see the Rhine Falls, explore Zürich Old Town and catch the sunset at Lindenhof.

            At this point, your Swiss Travel Pass will have expired, so you can get around the city using local public buses or by walking.
            When it's time to leave the city en route to Zürich Airport, you have the option of taking a direct train from Zürich HB station, which takes approximately 10 minutes and costs $7.
            Alternatively, you can opt for a private car transfer for added convenience.

                                        <h2 class="bdm-title">Budget Considerations for Your 10-Day Switzerland Itinerary:</h2>
                                        <h3>1. Food</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Eating out anywhere in Switzerland can be pricey, with meals costing at least $22 per person. Even a simple meal at an inexpensive restaurant can set you back $24, and a glass of water at restaurants costs $6.
                To save on food expenses, make use of the good ol' supermarkets like Coop and Migros, which are found all over Switzerland.
                Fortunately, Switzerland offers plenty of picturesque spots perfect for picnics, giving you a great excuse to enjoy supermarket food outdoors.
                Think of $4 salad pastas and $3 tuna sandwiches. Croissants, ham, and spreads in Switzerland are fresh and delicious for breakfast and lunch. Consider cooking dinner instead of eating out, and you'll discover a delightful world of Swiss flavors in the kitchen.

                                        </p>
                                        <h3>2. Accommodation:</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            When it comes to finding budget-friendly accommodation options for your <a target="_blank" href="/blog/switzerland-tourism" class='lnks'>Switzerland tour package</a>, hostels and Airbnb rooms are your best bets. While renting an entire Airbnb apartment can be relatively costly, opting for a private room is usually more affordable and comfortable, even for groups of three.
                Hostels are another great option for budget-conscious travelers. Not only are they affordable, but they're often conveniently located close to train stations and provide access to traveler necessities like kitchens, laundry facilities, and even complimentary breakfasts.
                One additional perk of staying in hostels is the opportunity to mingle with like-minded travelers from around the world.
                On average, hostels in Switzerland cost about $60 to $85 per person per night in a shared dormitory, which is considered reasonable by Swiss standards.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>3. Transport in Switzerland:</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Getting around Switzerland can be quite costly, especially when traveling within or between cities. For example, a single train ride from Lucerne to Interlaken could easily cost you $45.
                However, you can overcome this budget hurdle by planning your route strategically and maximizing the <a target="_blank" href="/blog/10-ultimate-benefits-of-swiss-travel-pass" class='lnks'>benefits of the Swiss Pass</a>.
                The Swiss Travel Pass is a flat-rate option that offers unlimited rides on buses and trains and provides discounted entry (often up to 50%) to various attractions across Switzerland. After doing the math, you'll realize that you can save a significant amount by purchasing this pass. It's a no-brainer for budget-conscious travelers.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Switzerland, with its stunning landscapes and vibrant cities, is a destination that should be on every traveler's bucket list.

                                            Interlaken city is strategically positioned on the flat alluvial land known as Bödeli, wedged between two pristine lakes – Lake Thun to the west and Lake Brienz to the east.

                                            The majestic Aare River flows gracefully through the town, connecting these two lakes and adding to the charm of the region.

                                        <p>
                                            Interlaken's transformation into an internationally renowned resort town began around the turn of the 19th century, thanks in part to the breathtaking landscapes captured by Swiss landscape artists like Franz Niklaus König.

                                            The Unspunnenfest, a celebration of Swiss culture, held in 1805 and 1808, played a pivotal role in attracting tourists to Interlaken. The festival showcased Swiss traditions, drawing visitors from near and far.

                                            Starting in the 1820s, tourists flocked to Interlaken seeking the healing properties of mountain air and spa treatments.

                                            In response to the burgeoning tourism industry, the town opened the grand Kursaal in 1859, providing an elegant spa experience for visitors.

                                            Excellent transportation links, including the opening of steamship routes along Lake Thun in 1835 and Lake Brienz in 1839, further facilitated tourism.

                                            In 1872, the Bödelibahn railway connected Interlaken to Därligen on Lake Thun, and two years later, it extended to Bönigen on Lake Brienz.

                                            This railway initially served as a link between the steamships on both lakes. However, in 1893, the Lake Thun railway line opened, providing a direct rail connection to Thun, which connected to Bern and other Swiss cities. In 1888, the Brünig railway opened, connecting Interlaken to Alpnachstad on Lake Lucerne and Brienz on Lake Brienz, offering travelers a seamless journey to Lucerne. By 1916, the Brünig railway had reached Interlaken from Brienz, providing a direct rail route to Lucerne

                                            In 1890, the Berner Oberland railway established connections to the tourist destinations of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald.

                                            As transport routes expanded, luxury hotels with panoramic views of the Jungfrau and surrounding mountains were constructed between 1860 and 1875 and later between 1890 and 1914. The current Kursaal, a symbol of Interlaken's history, was built in 1898-99 and remodeled in 1909–10.

                                            Despite its emphasis on tourism, Interlaken maintained diverse industries, including a parquet factory from 1850 to 1935 and a wool weaving factory that opened in 1921.

Although referendums in 1914 and 1927 voted against merging the three political municipalities into one, Interlaken's identity as a unified town continues to evolve.

Its unique position, cradled between Lake Brienz and Lake Thun, earned it the moniker "between lakes" (Interlaken). The Aare River gracefully meanders through the town, flowing from Lake Thun to Lake Brienz, though it does not traverse the municipality of Interlaken itself.

Of this land, 24.4% is allocated for agricultural purposes, 22.6% is covered by lush forests, and 47.2% is settled with buildings and roads. Rivers and lakes account for 7.0%, and unproductive land makes up 0.2% of the total area.

Transportation infrastructure, including roads and railways, accounts for 16.0%. Parks, green belts, and sports fields make up an additional 4.0% of the area. Forested land is divided into heavily forested (20.9%) and orchards or small clusters of trees (1.6%). Agricultural land is used for both crop cultivation (6.5%) and pastures (16.3%).

                                            Nestled in an Alpine setting at the northwestern end of Lake Zürich, Zürich is not just Switzerland's largest city but also the capital of the canton of Zürich.

                                        <p>
                                            This vibrant metropolis, known for its financial prowess, cultural richness, and industrial strength, is a testament to Switzerland's blend of natural beauty and urban innovation.

                                            With its stunning location between two forested chains of hills and the confluence of two rivers, the Limmat and Sihl, Zürich is an enchanting cityscape spread over 34 square miles (88 square km).

                                            Zürich's history is as rich and diverse as its modern character. The city's roots trace back to prehistoric times when the region was inhabited by peoples who built hut dwellings atop pile foundations driven into the shores of Lake Zürich. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As time passed, the Celtic Helvetii established a community on the right bank of the Limmat River. When the Romans arrived around 58 BCE, they recognized the strategic significance of the settlement and transformed it into a customs post, aptly naming it Turicum.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Roman Rule and the Emergence of Zürich</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Under Roman rule, Turicum flourished, evolving into a small army stronghold with a neighboring vicus, or Roman village.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As Rome's influence waned, the Alemanni, a Germanic people from the north, and later the Franks, made Zürich their home, elevating it to a royal residence.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Joining the Swiss Confederation</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            The city's true ascent began when it became an imperial free city in 1218. Zürich subsequently joined the Swiss Confederation in 1351, a coalition of cantons united against the Austrian Habsburgs.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In 1336, Zürich adopted a constitution, rooted in the guild system, which balanced power among various crafts, trades, and the nobility. As the guilds gained influence, the city purchased its freedom from the emperor in 1400, liberating it from tax obligations.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Zürich's strategic location on key trade routes further fueled economic growth, with the city controlling ever more surrounding territories.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>The Swiss Protestant Reformation</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            In 1519, a priest named Huldrych Zwingli preached a series of sermons at the Grossmünster ("Great Minster") that ignited the Swiss Protestant Reformation, forever altering Zürich's character. The city transformed into an industrious puritanical hub, maintaining robust trade and intellectual exchange with other Protestant cities such as Bern and Geneva.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            During the Counter-Reformation, Zürich welcomed refugees from northern Italy and France, further enhancing its cultural and economic vitality.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Napoleon and the Birth of Modern Zürich</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Napoleon's occupation of Switzerland in 1798 marked the end of the old political order, leading to the reorganization of Zürich under the Helvetic Republic, which aimed to create a unified Swiss state. However, the city's residents resisted centralized control, sparking years of conflicts with the surrounding countryside and other cantons.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Napoleon eventually mediated in 1803, establishing the canton of Zürich, which became a sovereign member of the new Swiss Confederation, ushering in a liberal democratic era by 1816.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Transformation in the 19th Century</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            The 1830 July Revolution in Paris spurred similar movements in Swiss cantons, including Zürich. The people gained the ability to elect and exert control over both the legislative and executive branches of government.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In 1831, a new canton constitution was drafted, becoming a model for other Swiss cities and influencing the 1874 revision of Switzerland's national constitution.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Zürich underwent significant changes in the late 18th century, with about a quarter of its population engaged in textile manufacturing. This industry replaced the medieval silk production, which lost its significance after French occupation.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Over time, agriculture and textiles gave way to small-scale industry, with local factories specializing in various goods.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Key Role in 19th-century Transport</h3>

                                            Improved transportation played a vital role in the 19th century. One of Switzerland's first railway lines linked Zürich with the neighboring city of Baden, earning the nickname "Spanish Roll Railway" because the bread rolls it brought from Baden were reputedly still warm on arrival.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In 1882, the Zürich-Milan trans-Alpine railway line opened, made possible by the construction of the 10-mile (16.3-km) Gotthard Tunnel, designed by industrial and railway pioneer Alfred Escher.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Educational and Scientific Advancements</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            In the mid-19th century, the University of Zürich (1833), maintained by the canton, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (1855) were founded. The University of Zürich was notably the first in Europe to accept female students.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The city also boasted a long list of Nobel Prize winners, including Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, Albert Einstein, and Wolfgang Pauli in physics; Richard Ernst in chemistry; and Rolf Zinkernagel in medicine. Renowned authors hailing from Zürich included Gottfried Keller, Conrad Ferdinand Meyer, and Max Frisch.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Financial Ascendancy</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            The growth of the financial services sector was a response to the increasing demand for capital by burgeoning industries and railways.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In 1856, Escher founded the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt, a banking institute entirely dedicated to financing industrial and commercial projects.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            By the late 19th century, Zürich had solidified its position as Switzerland's financial and economic center, surpassing the banks of Basel and Geneva.

                                        <h3>World Wars and Asylum</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            During World War I, Switzerland remained neutral, and Zürich provided asylum to intellectuals such as James Joyce and Vladimir Ilich Lenin. In response to the war's horrors, the Dada art movement emerged at the Cabaret Voltaire, a small tavern established in 1916 by Hugo Ball on Spiegelgasse.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Banking and Controversy during World War II</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            In World War II, Zürich's banks utilized banking secrecy laws to assist the Nazi Party in laundering gold and stolen valuables. However, it wasn't until the 1990s that these banks' wartime roles were made public. In 1998, Credit Suisse Group and UBS AG, Switzerland's two largest banks, agreed to pay two billion Swiss francs to international Jewish organizations.

                                        <h3>Economic Transformation in the Late 20th Century</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            After World War II, Zürich's airport became Switzerland's primary international gateway, further strengthening the city's economic position.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            By the latter half of the 20th century, the textile industry had waned entirely, replaced by machine production. Simultaneously, the service sector, especially banking and insurance companies, gained prominence.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The National Bank of Switzerland, headquartered in Zürich and Bern, played a crucial role by installing its board of directors in Zürich and introducing absolute banking confidentiality. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The temporary closure of the London Gold Exchange in 1968 prompted Zürich's banks to establish the Zürich Gold Pool, solidifying the city's status as one of the world's leading gold trading centers.

                                        <h3>Population Growth and Urban Challenges</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            The postwar period witnessed an influx of immigrants, both from rural Switzerland and abroad, propelling the city's population beyond administrative boundaries and into the hinterland.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            For the first time, the city and its surrounding area surpassed a population of one million.

                                        <h3>Financial Challenges and Rebound</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            The early 21st century presented financial challenges for Zürich, as the city's finance-oriented economy was rattled by crises in the global financial markets following corporate collapses and a tumultuous stock market in the United States.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In 2001, Zürich-based Swiss Air Transport Company Ltd. (Swissair) collapsed due to an aggressive business expansion strategy and the airline crisis post-September 11 attacks.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            However, elements of the former airline emerged as

The recovery of the financial markets in subsequent years ushered in a period of prosperity for the city, cementing Zürich's position as Switzerland's uncontested economic capital.

                                        <h3>Non-EU Status and Economic Development</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Moreover, Switzerland's resistance to joining the European Union (EU) did not hinder Zürich's economic development. Bilateral agreements with the EU gave Switzerland full access to EU markets. Zürich continued to thrive as an international business hub, leveraging its financial expertise.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Investment in Sustainable Development</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Since the 1990s, Zürich has been governed by a center-left coalition of parties, spearheading efforts to create sustainable development while maintaining its status as Switzerland's economic center. The city collaborates with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the University of Zürich, both renowned for their expertise in environmental sciences. Together, they pursue ambitious energy, environmental, and spatial development policies, contributing to Zürich's reputation as an innovative and forward-thinking metropolis.

                                            Zürich's strategic location allows easy access to Switzerland's stunning Alps. While the city itself may not be in the heart of the mountains, the nearby Uetilberg mountain offers panoramic views of the Alps, the lake, and the city. It's a hub for paragliding, hiking, biking, skiing, and sledging in winter. Zürich also provides excellent access to Switzerland's top ski resort areas, such as Amden, Stoos, and Hochstuckli.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Guildhalls and Traditions</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            In Zürich, guildhalls play a significant role in its cultural history. Beyond religious influence, it was the merchants who held sway over the city. From the baker's guild to the textile guild and goldsmith guild, these guildhalls, known as "zunfthauser," are scattered throughout the city, bearing witness to Zürich's rich heritage.

                                            Zürich is at the heart of a constantly expanding metropolitan area, encompassing central, northern, and eastern Switzerland. It serves as the industrial, financial, and cultural epicenter of the country, offering a vibrant and cosmopolitan atmosphere.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The city center itself is adorned with green spaces that stretch to Lake Zürich's shores, adorned with picturesque public parks and extending up to the slopes of Zürichberg.

                                        <h3>Diverse Ethnic Composition</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            One of Zürich's most defining features is its diverse ethnic composition, with over one-third of its population being immigrants. Major immigrant groups hail from Italy, the Balkans, Portugal, and Germany, with a smaller population of non-European immigrants.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The integration of immigrants, especially those displaced by conflicts in the Balkans and from non-European countries, presented challenges, particularly for schools, at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            However, the resulting ethnic tensions have eased, thanks to social programs targeting immigrants and tighter restrictions on immigration from outside the EU. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Switzerland and Zürich experienced fewer migrants compared to other Western European countries during the migrant crisis of 2015–16, partly due to the smaller Muslim diaspora in Switzerland, making it a less attractive destination for those fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and Africa.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Religious Diversity</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Zürich was historically a Protestant stronghold, but by the early 21st century, only about one-third of its inhabitants identified as Protestant. Roman Catholicism became the dominant religion, largely due to immigration.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Immigrants from the Balkans and Turkey have contributed to a growing Muslim community, while a small Jewish community also calls Zürich home.
                                        </p>

Notable landmarks include the Romanesque Grossmünster, believed to have been built by Charlemagne in the 700s, the 13th-century St. Peter's Church, and elegant guild houses and patrician residences. Some of these historic buildings are now used as restaurants or for civic functions.

                                            Zürich has nurtured a rich cultural life that has often been characterized by innovation and experimentation. The Zürich Opera House (1891), the Schauspielhaus (Theatre; 1901), and the Schiffbau (Shipping Hall; 2001) have earned international acclaim. The city boasts its orchestra, the Tonhalle, which has its own hall, where the Zürich Chamber Orchestra also performs. Cabaret Voltaire, reopened in 2004 in the Altstadt, has revived Zürich's tradition of avant-garde performance.

The Knabenschiessen in September is a sharpshooting contest for young people. Alongside these traditional events, Zürich boasts the Zürich Carnival (Fasnacht) in late winter and the Street Parade in August.

                                            However, since this is a reserved-only train, you will have to reserve your seat well in advance and depending on the season, the reservation can take you back by around 25 to 40 Swiss Francs. The extension from Tirano to Lugano by bus can cost between 14 to 16 Swiss Francs.

                                            The train offers first and second class cabins and you can opt for the class of reservation that matches your Swiss Travel Pass or Eurail Pass. Both classes have panoramic windows to ensure you get a seamless view of the scenery.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            However, the first class cabins are fitted with fewer, larger leather-furnished seats and therefore offer more space. The 2nd class cabin has two columns with two seats on either side of the aisle whereas the first class cabin has a column with two seats and a column with one seat making it ideal for solo travelers too.

                                        <p>
                                            This can be a bit tricky since the reservation and the ticket booking itself open at two different times. The reservation for the seat can be done up to 6 months in advance of the travel date whereas the ticket itself can be purchased only 60 days ahead.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            If you hold the Swiss Travel Pass or the Eurail Pass, you will not need to purchase the ticket so go ahead and book your seat reservations as soon as you have decided on the segment and class of travel. In the summer, reservations can be really difficult especially over weekends and school vacation periods.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Keep in mind that if you are traveling in winter, the SBB timetable is updated every December and therefore the December reservations may not be possible far in advance.

                                            The Bernina Express operates all year round but the frequency of trains differ per season and segment so this can be a bit confusing.

                                        <p>
                                            In a nutshell, the Chur to Tirano segment operates all year with one train in winter and two trains in summer. The St Moritz to Tirano segment operates with three trains in summer and one train in the winter but it is not a daily operation throughout the winter season.

                                            The summer season is normally from mid-May to mid-October. The rest of the year is considered their winter season and timetable.

                                            The Bernina Express bus between Tirano and Lugano and vice versa operates Thursday to Sunday from mid-February to March and October to November. It operates daily from March to October. There are no bus operation from November to mid- February.

                                            There is no restaurant on board the Bernina Express. However, they do have a mini-cart, or what they call a roving minibar, that can serve your refreshments and beverages at your seat. The menu mainly consists of a few

However, it is not cheap and you do have the option of carrying your own food.

                                            Almost every traveler's question is which side of the train offers the best views. Well, both sides offer great views through the panoramic windows.

                                            However, the right side is preferred while traveling from Switzerland to Italy and the left side, from Italy to Switzerland.

                                            This being said, keep in mind that there is no way of knowing the directions of the cabins when you book your ticket so ensuring the preferred side of the cabin is not possible. The RhB site itself clearly mentions that there is no information on the driving direction available.

                                            While you should definitely experience the Bernina Express journey once, it would be perfect if you could do it more than once and in different seasons.

Luggage can be stowed below your seats and on the luggage racks. Also, the luggage racks in the second class offer more space than those in the first class.

                                            Feel the dip in the temperature as the train reaches its highest elevation at 2253 meters and offers stunning views of the snow capped peaks, the Morteratsch glacier  and surrounding rugged terrain.

                                            A stop at Alp Grum at 2091 meters offers the opportunity for some fantastic photographs. The station itself  is built out of natural stone and has an adjoining restaurant that offers views over the Piz Palu (glacier). This glacier also lends its name to the crystalline Palu See (lake) of the region.

                                            Another engineering marvel and iconic of the Rhaetian Railway, this bridge between Poschiavo and Tirano is made up of nine arches, each 10 meters in diameter. You can get amazing views of this as the train descends around a tight right-hand curve.

                                            This picturesque natural reservoir surrounded by mountains is situated 962 meters above sea level. As the train runs parallel to its promenade you feel as though you can actually reach out and touch its gleaming azure waters. Moving southward, you can turn back to see the distant mountains from where you descended.

                                            The Jungfrau's imposing presence and challenging terrain made it a formidable obstacle for early explorers and climbers. The first recorded attempt to climb the Jungfrau was in 1811 by the Meyer brothers of Aarau and two chamois hunters from Valais.

                                        <p>
                                            Their expedition, which followed a long and arduous route over glaciers and high passes, culminated in the successful ascent of the summit on August 3, 1811. This historic achievement marked the first recorded ascent of the Jungfrau and laid the foundation for future explorations of the mountain.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Following the Meyer brothers' pioneering ascent, interest in the Jungfrau as a climbing challenge grew steadily. In 1828, several men from Grindelwald successfully reached the summit, further establishing the mountain's reputation as a formidable climb.

                                            The early ascents of the Jungfrau were marked by daring feats of mountaineering skill and endurance, as climbers navigated treacherous terrain and unpredictable weather conditions to reach the summit.

                                            One of the most notable early ascents of the Jungfrau took place in 1863 when a party consisting of three young Oxford University graduates and three Swiss guides successfully reached the summit and returned to base camp in less than 11 hours. This feat of speed and endurance was a remarkable achievement for the time and further cemented the Jungfrau's reputation as a challenging and prestigious climb.

                                            The first winter ascent of the Jungfrau was made on January 23, 1874, by Meta Brevoort and W. A. B. Coolidge with guides Christian and Ulrich Almer. This winter ascent, which required the use of a sled to reach the upper Aletsch Glacier, demonstrated the extreme conditions and challenges faced by climbers attempting to conquer the Jungfrau in winter.

                                            Over the years, the Jungfraujoch mountain has been climbed via various routes, each presenting its own set of challenges and rewards.

                                            The construction of the Jungfrau Railway in the early 20th century provided climbers and tourists with easier access to the mountain, but the allure of the traditional climbing routes remains strong for those seeking a more challenging and authentic alpine experience.

Whether attempting a traditional climb or taking the Jungfrau Railway to the Jungfraujoch, the saddle between the Mönch and the Jungfrau, visitors to this iconic mountain are sure to be captivated by its majesty and grandeur.

                                            The development of tourism around the Jungfrau has a rich history that parallels the mountain's growing reputation as a premier destination for travelers seeking adventure and natural beauty.

                                            The construction of the Jungfrau Railway in the early 20th century played a pivotal role in transforming the Jungfrau region into a popular tourist destination, opening up the mountain and its surrounding area to visitors from around the world.

                                            Adolf Guyer-Zeller's vision of a railway tunnel to the Jungfraujoch, conceived in 1893, marked the beginning of a new era for tourism in the region.

                                            The ambitious project aimed to make the glaciated areas on the south side of the Jungfrau more accessible, providing tourists with a unique opportunity to experience the wonders of the high Alps up close.

                                            The building of the Jungfrau Railway tunnel was a monumental task that took 16 years to complete. The summit station was finally opened in 1912, offering visitors a scenic journey through the heart of the Alps to the Jungfraujoch railway station at 3,454 m (11,332 ft).

                                        <p>
                                            The Jungfrau offers several climbing routes, each with its own set of challenges and rewards. The normal route, which follows the traces of the first climbers, starts from the Mönchsjoch Hut and traverses the Jungfraufirn glacier before ascending the southern ridge to the summit. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            While not considered a very difficult climb, the route can be dangerous on the upper section above the Rottalsattel, where most accidents happen.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Another popular route is the northeast ridge, which connects the summit from the Jungfraujoch. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This route is more difficult and dangerous, requiring climbers to navigate steep and exposed terrain. The first ascent of the northeast ridge was made in 1911 by Albert Weber and Hans Schlunegger.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In addition to these main routes, there are several other routes that offer varying degrees of difficulty and technical challenge.

                                            The construction of the Jungfrau Railway has made access to the mountain easier, but climbers still face the inherent risks and challenges of high-altitude mountaineering when attempting to climb the Jungfrau.

                                            One of the main reasons for the Jungfrau's popularity among tourists is the Jungfraujoch Railway. This railway, which opened in 1912, is the highest in Europe and takes passengers from Kleine Scheidegg to the Jungfraujoch railway station at 3,454 meters (11,332 ft). The journey is an attraction in itself, offering stunning views of the surrounding mountains and glaciers.

                                            Conservation efforts in the Jungfrau region are crucial to protect its unique alpine environment and delicate ecosystems. The region is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts a top priority.

                                            One of the main conservation initiatives in the Jungfrau region is the protection of its glaciers, including the Aletsch Glacier, which is the largest glacier in the Alps.

                                            Climate change poses a significant threat to the Jungfrau region, with rising temperatures leading to glacier retreat, changes in precipitation patterns, and an increased risk of natural disasters such as landslides and avalanches.

                                        <p>
                                            Conservation efforts in the region must focus on mitigating these impacts and preserving the unique alpine environment for future generations.

                                        <p>
                                            One of the key challenges facing conservation efforts in the Jungfrau region is balancing tourism with environmental protection.

                                        <p>
                                            While tourism is a vital source of income for the region, it also puts pressure on fragile ecosystems. Sustainable tourism practices, such as limiting the number of visitors to sensitive areas and promoting responsible travel, are essential to protect the region's natural beauty.

                                            Lucerne has positioned itself as Switzerland's most business-friendly canton, largely due to its continuous tax-cutting policies.

                                        <p>
                                            Lucerne has a rich history in export-oriented industries, dating back to the 14th century when scythe production flourished. The city imported iron and steel, while local blacksmiths crafted scythes, which were then exported to western Switzerland and northern Italy. These blacksmith workshops, situated on the outskirts of the city for fire safety reasons, often relied on watermills to power their hammers, marking an early example of Lucerne's innovative and industrious spirit.

                                            Lucerne's medieval architecture, primarily found in the Old Town along the River Reuss, creates an enchanting atmosphere for visitors. The traffic-free Old Town is a treasure trove of timber-framed houses, fresco-covered guild halls, and picturesque alleyways. Notable highlights include the Old Town Hall, the 14th-century clock tower, Weinmarkt with its charming fountain, and Kapellplatz, home to Lucerne's oldest church, St. Peter's Chapel. Exploring these historic sites transports visitors back in time, offering a glimpse into Lucerne's storied past.

                                            Europe's oldest covered bridge, the Chapel Bridge, is a symbol of Lucerne's history. Built in the 14th century, it features 17th-century pictorial panels illustrating the city's past.

                                            While some panels were tragically lost in a fire in 1993, the bridge was painstakingly rebuilt, and the 700-year-old Water Tower adjacent to it remains a testament to the city's enduring resilience.

The somber expression of the dying lion, juxtaposed with the Swiss shield and the fleur-de-lis, evokes a sense of sacrifice and heroism that resonates with visitors from around the world.

                                            The St. Moritz Games, also known as the V Olympic Winter Games, took place from January 30 to February 8, 1948. Despite the challenges of the post-war era, the Games were a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring appeal of winter sports.

                                            One of the defining features of the 1948 Games was the spirit of improvisation and resourcefulness among the athletes.

                                        <p>
                                            Many countries were still recovering from the effects of the war and were unable to properly equip their teams. As a result, athletes had to make do with what they had, often improvising equipment and gear.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Despite these challenges, the Games were a success, thanks in part to the efforts of the Swiss organizers. Saint Moritz, which had remained largely untouched by the war due to Switzerland's neutrality, provided a picturesque backdrop for the Games, with its snow-covered mountains and pristine Alpine landscapes.
                                        </p>

                                            The Games saw several memorable performances from athletes. French Alpine skier Henri Oreiller was one of the standout performers, winning two gold medals and one bronze.

                                        <p>
                                            In singles figure skating, American Dick Button made history by becoming the first American to win a gold medal in the event. Canadian Barbara Scott also made history by becoming the first and only Canadian to win the women's title.

                                            The 1948 Games also saw the revival of skeleton sledding, a headfirst sledding event that had not been held at the previous Games. The event was discontinued after 1948 due to the risk of injury but was reintroduced at the 2002 Winter Olympics.

                                        <p>
                                            Lauterbrunnen is located in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, approximately 70 kilometers (43 miles) southeast of the city of Bern. Nestled in the heart of the Jungfrau Region, Lauterbrunnen is surrounded by other famous alpine destinations, including Grindelwald and Wengen. The Lauterbrunnen Valley itself stretches about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) and is characterized by towering limestone cliffs that rise as much as 800 meters (2,600 feet) on either side, creating a breathtaking natural amphitheater.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Often referred to as a U-shaped valley, Lauterbrunnen was formed by glaciers during the last Ice Age. This distinctive shape, combined with the steep walls, creates a dramatic sense of enclosure, making visitors feel as if they are in a natural fortress. The valley is renowned for its stunning waterfalls, with 72 cascading down from the high cliffs, the most famous being the Staubbach Falls, which plunges nearly 300 meters (1,000 feet) into the valley below. These waterfalls are fed by melting snow and glacial runoff from the surrounding peaks, contributing to the valley's enchanting atmosphere.

                                            In addition to its stunning natural features, Lauterbrunnen is one of the few remaining areas in the Alps where traditional farming practices are still maintained. During the summer months, the alpine meadows come alive with grazing cows, highlighting the agricultural heritage that is a core part of the valley's identity. This blend of breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural history makes Lauterbrunnen a remarkable destination for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts alike.

                                        <p>
                                            Lauterbrunnen has a rich history that dates back hundreds of years, with its first mention in historical records occurring in the 13th century. The name "Lauterbrunnen" is derived from the German words “lauter,” meaning “pure” or “many,” and “brunnen,” meaning “springs” or “fountains,” a reference to the valley's abundant springs and cascading waterfalls that define its landscape.
                                        </p>

                                            The valley gained significant attention in the early 20th century when renowned author J.R.R. Tolkien visited Lauterbrunnen in 1911. He was profoundly struck by the dramatic beauty and serene atmosphere of the valley, which inspired his depiction of Rivendell, the elven sanctuary in The Lord of the Rings series. Much like Lauterbrunnen, Rivendell is portrayed as a hidden valley surrounded by towering cliffs and waterfalls, capturing the essence of Tolkien's enchanting world.

                                            Switzerland has long been known as the land of alpine charm, pristine lakes, and majestic mountains.

                                            This <a href="/blog/12-days-switzerland-itinerary" class="lnks" target="_blank">12 days Switzerland itinerary</a> is designed to take you through both the well-trodden tourist paths and the hidden gems that often escape the attention of first-time visitors. We’ll start in the cosmopolitan city of Zurich, with its bustling streets and serene lakeside vistas, before diving into the heart of Switzerland’s more exotic landscapes. You’ll witness the untamed beauty of the waterfalls in Lauterbrunnen, the serenity of lesser-known mountain escapes like Arosa, and even take in the awe-inspiring Matterhorn in Zermatt.

In both classes, you can call for meals at your table. The only difference is the seating, which is plusher and more spaced out in 1st class. The 2nd class has two columns with two seats each on either side of the aisle, and the 1st class has a column of two and a column of one.

                                            The Excellence Class is an all-window-seat cabin and includes an aperitif, a 5-course meal and bar service. I have not travelled in it myself, but if you are feeling exceptionally splurgy or are celebrating a special event, this would be a great way to do so. A ride on the Glacier Express Excellence Class would definitely take one of the <strong>most scenic train journeys in Switzerland</strong> to a new elevated level.

                                            As you can see in the above list, the Swiss Travel Pass is valid on all the panoramic trains. It gives you a great price advantage since you are not required to purchase pricey tickets and just pay for the reservations instead. Besides the advantage of the panoramic trains, the Swiss Travel Pass gives unlimited travel on all kinds of public transport, entrance to hundreds of museums and great discounts on all major mountain excursions.

                                            Regarding the reservations, you can opt for reservations in the class of your pass. If you have a 2nd-class pass, you can opt for a 2nd-class reservation. However, if you hold a 2nd-class pass and wish to travel 1st class on the panoramic trains, you have to purchase what is known as a 'class upgrade'.

The train, the route, the scenery, the diverse terrain all just come together to make this one of my top activities in Switzerland.

                                            Interlaken in the Bernese Oberland area is quite an adventure sports hub. It is popular for adventures like helicopter skydiving, airplane skydiving, white water rafting and paragliding. Personally, I am not much of an adventure sports buff, but when I heard that I could do paragliding accompanied by an expert, I was all for giving it a go, and I am so glad I did. It was an experience of a lifetime.

Almost all of the popular resorts, such as Interlaken, Zermatt, St. Moritz and Lucerne, offer amazing adventure activities.

                                            This is probably the most popular activity in Interlaken. There are various adventure sports companies that offer scenic <a href="/adventure-tours/paragliding-summer/?id=act_e8172ddc-7958-4e46-a56e-f887cffa60aa" class="lnks" target="_blank">tandem paragliding</a> rides, allowing you to soar high above the scenic town, its turquoise lakes and surrounding mountains. Typically, you are picked up from your hotel or a central point in Interlaken and driven to a launch site in a nearby village such as Beatenberg, where you receive a briefing before takeoff. The airborne time is between 10 and 20 minutes and the views over Lake Thun and the Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau mountains are absolutely fantastic.

                                            Interlaken's lakes beckon to be explored. You can opt for a leisurely ferry ride across them or for a real adrenaline-pumping 45-minute <a href="/adventure-tours/scenic-jetboat-ride/?id=act_2ba016e1-514e-422c-b4f9-07884e6b6aa8" class="lnks" target="_blank">Jetboat ride</a>. The Jetboat pier located at Bonigen, is a short bus ride from Interlaken. Before takeoff, you are given a briefing and the necessary waterproof gear for the ride. Taking off with your captain, the ride takes you past scenic points like Iseltwald (now also famous as the location for various scenes from Crash Landing On You) and the thundering Giessbach Falls. Be prepared to have a blast and get splashed as the boat takes swift turns and 360-degree spins before getting you back to the starting point. Since almost any program to Switzerland will include Interlaken, you can easily incorporate this short but thrilling activity into any program.

                                            While this activity may not be for everyone (definitely not for this writer 😣), if you have the nerves needed, it is something you will cherish forever. Gliding down over Interlaken with your parachute will give you the most unique views of the Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau and the two glistening lakes Thun and Brienz. A typical <a href="/adventure-tours/helicopter-skydive-from-interlaken/?id=act_860dadec-1eec-4dd4-9f41-34b8e01f44ae" class="lnks" target="_blank">helicopter skydive</a> program would offer a central pick-up point or a hotel pick-up. You are treated to a 10-minute scenic flight through the narrow Lutschental valley and the Schynige Platte mountain ridge before you get ready for your jump from roughly 14000 feet!! You will need approximately 2 hours in total for this activity. You can also consider adding another popular excursion, such as the <a href="/mountain-excursion/2-harder-kulm" class="lnks" target="_blank">Harder Kulm</a> in Interlaken, on the same day. In fact, an evening drink and snack atop the Harder Kulm would be the perfect end to an exhilarating day.

It offers nine courses of varying difficulty and over 150 different challenges, ranging from ground level to 23 metres. From toddlers to teenagers, there is something for everyone here.

                                            Grindelwald First is also known as the Top of Adventure and definitely lives up to its moniker. It is the only mountain excursion that offers one way to ascend (by cable car) but four different and exciting ways to descend from it, and you have the option of choosing either one or all.<br />
                                            Start with the First Flyer, a zipline that has you securely fastened and flying through the 800m cable at 84 km/h.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The First Glider has you flying under the enormous wings of an eagle while being horizontally harnessed under it.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The Mountain Cart is similar to a go-cart but really close to the ground and with very wide tyres for safety. You can control the speed with the hydraulic brakes, but hey, don't forget you are here for the thrill.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Finally, the Trottibike will remind you of the bike that you rode as a child and will take you down the last leg of the descent.
                                        </p>

                                            A short bus ride from Grindelwald town centre (or a roughly 35-minute walk) takes you to the <a href="/attractions/glacier-canyon-grindelwald/?id=act_d2f762b7-6606-458b-811c-6a9611d9b21b" class="lnks" target="_blank">Glacier Canyon</a>, an amazing natural attraction carved by nature over centuries. Inside the gorge, there is an elevated walkway that allows you to take a sensory walk through its exposed rock galleries and tunnels. If you have the nerves to take a wobbly walk (or crawl), you can try to cross a spider web stretched 170m2 across the gorge and 7 metres over the flowing Lutschine River.<br />
                                            The big thrill here however, is the Canyon Swing. The swing platform sits on the edge of the canyon wall 90 metres above the glacier melt below.  Once you have passed the safety briefing and crossed the safety barrier, it's time to take the leap of faith, step off and swing at 120 km/h between the canyon walls. The few seconds of this swing may just be the most exhilarating ones of your life.

                                        <p>
                                            Whilst many may not see this as an adventurous or tough hiking trail, it is definitely one of the most popular activities in the area. The hike takes you to 5 different lakes, each one unique in its own way. You start by taking the mountain train to Sunnegga and then the gondola to Blauherd (the tickets are part of the <a href="/blog/top-discounts-on-swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Top discounts on the Swiss Travel Pass</a>). From here, you simply follow the well-marked ‘5 Seenweg’ trail. The entire hike takes between 2.30 to 3 hours. If you are lucky, you will see the monumental Matterhorn massif all along the way and also as a reflection in the lakes (which makes for some really memorable photos). Witnessing the changing hues of the water as you pass by the five lakes (Stellisee, Grindjisee, Grunsee, Mossjisee, Leisee) is a visual treat.

                                            Zermatt is arguably the best all-round Ski resort in the Alps with over 200 kms of pistes. Its three main mountains offer enough and more for every level of skier. To ski with the best views of the Matterhorn, one can head to the Sunnegga-Rothorn area. For intermediate skiers, the Gornergrat sector offers long cruising runs with fantastic views. For more advanced skiers seeking a real adrenaline rush, the Kleine Matterhorn area, with its numerous options, is the place to test their skills. This area is also the highest and largest summer ski area in Europe, offering almost 21 km of slopes.  Zermatt’s varied terrain and snow conditions also make it the ideal spot for those wishing to explore off-piste options.

                                            If you are not a ski fan but still want a snow activity, a snowshoe hike is the perfect fit. The route between Trockener Steg and Schwarzsee on the trail of the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise is a popular area for this hike. There are other trails along the Sunnegga-Rothorn area too. Keep in mind that you will need to travel to the start point of these trails by cable car, for which you will receive discounts if you hold a <a href="/swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Travel Pass</a>.

                                            For the avid adventure seeker wanting to take the skiing experience one notch further, there is heliskiing. The heliski operators either fly you to one of the mountain landing sites or to one of the off-piste spots from where you drop on fresh powder snow to descend through the most beautiful alpine landscapes with a mountain guide. Popular on-piste landing points are Monte Rosa landing area (4200 metres) and the Aeschihorn landing area (3600 metres).

                                            One of the most fun activities to do with the family is sledging (also called Luge in Zermatt). You can do it solo or even with kids riding along with an adult. The most popular run in the Zermatt area is the Rotenboden toboggan run, which is the highest run in the Alps, starting at 2815 metres. There are also husky dog sledge rides where a pack of well-trained and super-friendly huskies pulls the sledge. You can do this near Trockener Steg on the way to Matterhorn Glacier Paradise. Yet another form is using a snooc, which is a seat fixed atop a short ski.  There are runs with varying degrees of difficulty and speed but rest assured, every one of them is a treat.

                                            St Moritz is home to the Olympia Bob Run, the world's oldest and natural bobsleigh track. The 1722-metre track with some really challenging curves has been in operation since 1904 and hosted events for two Winter Olympics and numerous other European and international competitions. Unlike all other bobsleigh tracks, which are artificially iced, this one is the last remaining naturally iced track in the world.

                                            With the pristine lake St Moritz and the lush forests and Alpine peaks surrounding it, there are plenty of scenic hiking trails around St Moritz. Leisure walkers can walk around the lake and explore the area and town. The more serious hikers can head to popular trails like the Muottas Muragl to Alp Languard trail (6.3 km, roughly 2 hours), the Corvatsch Panorama Trail (6 km, roughly 2 hours), and the Morteratsch Glacier Walk, which is perfect for families since it is an easy 6 km round trip on a wide dirt path.

                                            Located in Engelberg, 45 minutes from Lucerne, <a href="/mountain-excursion/5-mount-titlis" class="lnks" target="_blank">Mount Titlis</a> has something for all kinds of adventure seekers. Start the fun with a ride in the Rotair (the world’s first revolving aerial cableway) that takes you to the summit. A huge attraction on the peak at 3041 metres, is  Europe’s highest suspension bridge. Gather the courage to walk on it and peer down into the icy depth below and you will be rewarded with breathtaking views. Take a ride on the Ice Flyer Chair Lift and visit Glacier Park, where you can try the snake gliss, minibob or glide down on a snow tube.

                                            Along the ascent or descent, at the midway station of Trubsee, the Adventure Park offers a plethora of activities. Try your skills at the Bagjump or the zipline. Get more adventurous at the SnowXpark with various kinds of electric vehicles like the moonbike, bobsled and the e-snowmibile. End the day with a glass of mulled wine on the balcony of your hotel or <a href="/apartments" class="lnks" target="_blank">apartment in Lucerne</a>.

                                            Known as the Dragon Mountain, this mountain is replete with legends. However, today, it is better known for the amazing Golden Round Trip, which involves an exciting journey to and from it. The Golden Round Trip (possible in summer) takes you via cable car, steamer and the world’s steepest cogwheel railway with a maximum gradient of 48%!

                                            The rope park at the midway point of Frakmuntegg offers 10 courses and exciting ziplines catering to all levels. Not to leave the kids out of the fun, there is also the Pilu Rope Park, which caters primarily to kids aged 4 to 8. The toboggan run, with its steep curves and jumps, is the longest summer run, stretching 1350 metres.

For the leisure seeker, there are ferry cruises, yacht cruises and more. However, for those seeking something a little more active, there is kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding and canoeing. There are guided services or rentals that allow you to do things at your own pace.

                                            Of course, with Switzerland’s endless natural beauty and landscape of forests, mountains, and lakes, there are many other places and activities to enjoy. Listing them all here would be almost impossible.

Wait no more-choose the next slope to ski down, the next forest trail to traverse and the next mountain to soar over. Once that is done, just grab the gear and get going!

                                            If you have decided to travel to Switzerland, you have most likely started researching all the travel pass options and have come across several. For a country as compact as Switzerland, the abundance of choices can be overwhelming. The possibilities range from Day Passes and Regional Passes to Half Fare Passes and the Swiss Travel Passes, which come in consecutive and flexi formats.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            After various trips to Switzerland, I have realised that for the average tourist wanting to explore as much as possible within a time frame, the Swiss Travel Pass offers the best value.<br />
                                            However, the question still remains: do you opt for a <u>Swiss Travel Pass 1st Class or a 2nd Class</u>, and what is the difference? As annoying as this may sound, the answer to this question is “it depends on your requirements”.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Both 1st and 2nd Class Swiss Travel Passes offer unlimited travel on buses, boats, trains and trams. They offer a couple of free mountain excursions and varying discounts on other popular mountain railways and cableways. The discounts range from 25% to 50% on very popular excursions such as the <a href="/mountain-excursion/1-jungfraujoch-top-of-europe" class="lnks" target="_blank">Jungfraujoch</a>, <a href="/mountain-excursion/7-matterhorn-glacier-paradise" class="lnks" target="_blank">Matterhorn Glacier Paradise</a> and <a href="/mountain-excursion/5-mount-titlis" class="lnks" target="_blank">Mount Titlis</a>.<br />
                                            Lastly, the pass includes the Swiss Museum Pass which offers access to over 500 museums, including Switzerland's most visited one - the <a href="/mountain-excursion/35-swiss-transport-museum" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Museum of Transport</a>.

                                            1st Class cabins are more spacious, with the seats being in a 2-aisle-1 formation, whereas 2nd Class cabins have a 2-aisle-2 formation. Also, the seat pitch is a little bigger in 1st Class.

                                        <p>
                                            The 1st class cabins tend to be quieter, and some trains even have ‘quiet zones’ where you cannot use cell phones or have loud conversations. These cabins are designed for those who want to catch up on some work, enjoy quiet reading or spend some time gazing at the amazing Swiss scenery in silence.
                                        </p>

                                        <p><u>Scenic trains:</u></p>
                                        <p>
                                            On panoramic trains like the <a href="/mountain-excursion/43-glacier-express" class="lnks" target="_blank">Glacier Express</a> and <a href="/mountain-excursion/42-bernina-express" class="lnks" target="_blank">Bernina Express</a>, the 1st Class cabins may offer more in-cabin service and larger panoramic windows.
                                        </p>

                                        <p><u>Amenities:</u></p>
                                        <p>
                                            Since one almost always travels with electronic gadgets, access to power sockets can be necessary. The 1st Class cabins will provide greater access to sockets next to the seats.<br />
                                            Does this mean that 2nd Class travel in Switzerland is not a pleasant experience?? Not at all. I have personally travelled in both classes several times and have had great experiences in both.

You can use the saved cash for other experiences, such as an adventure-filled day atop the <a href="/mountain-excursion/9-grindelwald-first" class="lnks" target="_blank">Grindelwald First</a> or a leisurely sail on the <a href="/mountain-excursion/34-saphir-panoramic-yacht-cruise" class="lnks" target="_blank">Saphir Panoramic Yacht Cruise</a> on Lake Lucerne.

                                        <p>
                                            If you have several long or cross-country journeys in your Switzerland itinerary, a 1st Class pass would provide the added comfort you need and also increase your chances of getting a seat during peak hours and seasons.

                                        <p><u>Seating requirement:</u></p>
                                        <p>
                                            If you are looking to be seated together as a family, the chance of getting such a seating arrangement would be greater in 1st Class. As a couple, you can opt for the single seaters facing each other. For a solo traveller or someone wanting to get some work done while travelling, the single-seater would be the perfect option.
                                        </p>

                                            If you are travelling with a lot of luggage, you will be able to get in and out of a less crowded compartment with ease. There would be a greater chance of getting luggage storage space on the racks at the end of the compartment, overhead and in between seats.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Trains tend to be quite crowded during rush hours and particularly during peak tourist seasons, so it would be good to opt for a 1st Class pass if you are planning to travel during these times.
                                        </p>

                                        <p><u>Scenic trains:</u></p>
                                        <p>
                                            If you plan to take a couple of panoramic trains, such as the <a href="/mountain-excursion/57-goldenpass-express" class="lnks" target="_blank">Golden Pass Express</a> or <a href="/mountain-excursion/58-gotthard-panorama-express" class="lnks" target="_blank">Gotthard Panorama Express</a>, you will benefit from the larger windows, cabin service, and greater space that 1st Class would provide for an overall enhanced experience. Some panoramic journeys can be long (the full Glacier Express journey is almost 8 hours) so having extra legroom and space would be nice.
                                        </p>

                                        <p><u>Special needs:</u></p>

                                            In case you are travelling with kids, require extra legroom for a particularly tall family member, or are travelling with a special-needs person, the 1st Class will provide the extra space and comfort needed.
                                        </p>

                                            One of the advantages of the Swiss transport system is that it also allows for class upgrades. This means that you can travel with a 2nd Class pass and pay for an upgrade on a particular segment that you wish. For example, you can opt for a class upgrade for just the Glacier Express or any other specific long journey that you are going to take. The Class Upgrade fare is the difference between the 1st and 2nd class ticket cost of a particular segment of travel and can be purchased at a station or via the Swiss Federal Railways website.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I have found this class upgrade particularly useful on trips where most of my travel included short segments, mountain trips (which often offer only one class of travel) and a single panoramic train like the Glacier Express. On such trips, taking a 2nd Class Swiss Travel Pass with a class upgrade only for the scenic journey made sense. This way, I avoided purchasing the 1st Class pass, which can cost 58% to 60% more than a 2nd Class pass.
                                        </p>

                                            As mentioned, the choice between 1st and 2nd Class depends upon your travel priorities.<br />
                                            If extra comfort and a quieter space are important to you, then spending the extra money is definitely worthwhile. However, if budget constraints or allocating expenses to other parts of your travel are essential, do not hesitate to opt for a 2nd Class pass, which offers excellent value for money and a lovely way to mingle with tons of fellow travellers.
                                        </p>

                                            Either way, the Swiss Travel Pass will be the perfect companion for a seamless, easy-to-use, comfortable travel experience through Switzerland. Buy it, download it and present it each time you need to use it. Travel can not get simpler, can it?

                                            I have often been asked what the perfect duration for a holiday to Switzerland is, and trust me, it’s not an easy question to answer.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <u>The ideal duration for a Switzerland holiday</u> depends upon your interests and, most certainly, upon your budget. Personally, after visiting the country so many times, I still feel there is so much that I have not seen or covered and would like to go back for.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            From the most charming towns, unending natural beauty, scenic train routes, mountain excursions, museums, adventure activities, winter sports, and so much more, Switzerland has something for every type of traveller and every budget. It's an absolute abomination to see travel companies include it for just 1 or 2 nights in most programs.

                                            If I really have to put a number on the nights that one should spend, I would say anything between 7 and 10 nights is what is needed to cover a few towns, visit a couple of mountains and do at least one or two of the absolutely stunning Swiss panoramic routes by train.

                                            However, if you are really pressed for time and budget, you can maybe do a 4-day Switzerland itinerary instead of a 6-day Switzerland itinerary.

                                            I have done a couple of 7-8 night programs and found them to be just the right fit.

                                            The first time around, we had decided to stay at serviced <a href="/apartments" class="lnks" target="_blank">apartments in Switzerland</a> and had broken up the 8-night Switzerland itinerary into apartments in Montreux and Interlaken.<br />
                                            From Montreux, we visited Zermatt and the <a href="/mountain-excursion/7-matterhorn-glacier-paradise" class="lnks" target="_blank">Matterhorn Glacier Paradise</a>, the Gruyères cheese factory and the beautiful town of Gstaad.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            From Interlaken, we travelled to Grindelwald and onward to the <a href="/mountain-excursion/1-jungfraujoch-top-of-europe" class="lnks" target="_blank">Jungfraujoch</a>. We also did a day tour to Lucerne and <a href="/mountain-excursion/6-mount-pilatus" class="lnks" target="_blank">Mount Pilatus</a>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The second time, we split the stays at hotels in Switzerland and stayed at St. Moritz, Zermatt, Lucerne and Zurich. The <a href="/mountain-excursion/43-glacier-express" class="lnks" target="_blank">Glacier Express</a> journey from St Moritz to Zermatt was definitely one of the highlights of this program. From Lucerne, we spent a day in Engelberg and <a href="/mountain-excursion/5-mount-titlis" class="lnks" target="_blank">Mount Titlis</a>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We also did a day tour to Grindelwald since we had not visited <a href="/mountain-excursion/9-grindelwald-first" class="lnks" target="_blank">Grindelwald First</a> earlier. Trust me, the fun activities like the First Flyer and Trotti bike are absolutely worth doing. We had only one night in Zurich, but a quick guided tour around the city and the Rhine Falls helped us to keep the evening free to visit the <a href="/mountain-excursion/47-lindt-chocolate" class="lnks" target="_blank">Lindt Home of Chocolate</a> (highly recommend it…and not only if you are travelling with kids)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            If you have less than 8 nights and want to do something like a 4-night program, the ideal thing to do would be to base yourself in one or two popular towns and cover the neighbouring areas and maybe one or two mountain excursions from those.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Luckily, the <a href="/swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Travel Pass</a> makes it really easy to travel between towns by train and also within towns on the local transport networks of buses and trams. It also gets you discounts on mountain railways and free or discounted entrances to museums.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            However, no matter how long you stay, you should make sure to leave some time to stroll around the quiet towns, marvel at the country’s dramatic natural landscapes and enjoy some leisurely local meals. These are things that will transform your trip into a truly memorable holiday.

The second time, staying in classic <a href="/hotels" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss hotels</a> felt more indulgent and gave us those postcard views right outside our windows.

                                        <p>
                                            Day trips are where Switzerland truly shines. Almost every big town opens doors to stunning day excursion possibilities. From Montreux, we wandered into Gruyères, sampled cheese at the factory, and then lost ourselves in the fairytale setting of Gstaad. Interlaken, Grindelwald and Lucerne were just an easy train ride away. These smaller trips allow you to explore Switzerland beyond its touristy face while making no compromises on beauty.

                                        <p>
                                            Zurich is often treated as just a stopover city, but I’d urge you not to skip it. Even with just a single night, we managed to pack in a quick guided stroll, enjoy a sunset at Lake Zurich, and witness the mighty Rhine Falls—Europe’s largest waterfall—just an hour away.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            And of course, the <a href="/mountain-excursion/47-lindt-chocolate" class="lnks" target="_blank">Lindt Home of Chocolate</a> is an absolute must. Walking through the museum, seeing the famous chocolate fountain, and tasting as much chocolate as you like feels like a dream. Whether you travel with kids or not, don’t leave Zurich without it.

                                            A practical option would be to spend 2 nights each in Zurich and Interlaken. Zurich will give you a taste of Swiss urban life along with easy access to the Rhine Falls, while Interlaken, located between two lakes and surrounded by mountains, opens a world of excursions.

                                            Even in a short itinerary, you won’t feel rushed, because the Swiss rail network is among the most efficient in the world. With just one pass in hand, the Swiss Travel Pass makes it seamless—no thinking twice about tickets, zones, or costing. You board and go, leaving all the logistics aside so you can focus on scenery and experiences.

You get unlimited travel on trains, buses and boats, and it covers most local transport networks in cities too. The pass also gives free entry to over 500 museums, discounted mountain excursions, and spares you the stress of ticket queues.

                                            Beyond cheese fondue and rösti, Swiss food has a heartwarming comfort to it. A simple plate of pasta in a mountain hut after a cable car ride or sampling raclette in a traditional chalet adds a rustic charm you can’t replicate at home.

                                            Switzerland and chocolate are inseparable. While big brands like Lindt and Toblerone are obvious choices, do step into local chocolatiers in small towns—you’ll be surprised at the artistry and uniqueness of their creations. Each box makes for the sweetest memory to take home.

                                            For watch enthusiasts (and even those who aren’t), Switzerland feels like a pilgrimage. While you may not be buying a luxury piece on every trip, visiting a boutique or a watch museum gives you a perspective on how deep the craftsmanship runs in this country.

                                            Sometimes it’s easy to forget, but Switzerland is also a sports-loving country. If you’re a football fan, simply catching a local club match or walking into a bar on match night connects you to the energy of its people. UEFA headquarters in Nyon is also a nice pilgrimage for football lovers.

These quiet moments—unplanned and unhurried—are often what you’ll remember long after the bigger sightseeing is over.

                                            As a country, Switzerland is a must-see destination on any traveller's bucket list, whether as a solo destination or part of a wider European itinerary. Then why do so many travellers and even travel companies give it a skip? Well, let's face it…Switzerland is expensive! Whilst nothing can change that, we can definitely try and figure out the best possible way of <u>budgeting for your holiday to Switzerland</u>. After all, who wants to miss a chance to visit paradise?

                                            Switzerland offers a wide range of accommodations. Depending on your budget, you can go from shared hostel dormitories to luxury hotels.

                                            <u>Hostels</u>: There are several hostels in cities like Zurich, Geneva, and Interlaken, and a few even include breakfast, so you can save on buying one outside (remember, this is Switzerland, and a coffee can cost almost SFr 5). Hostels range from around SFr 50 to 70 per person, depending on the number of beds in each dormitory.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Most of these hostels also offer private accommodation with en-suite facilities, but these can cost the same as a low- to mid-budget hotel, so it would be nice to do some homework before settling on this option.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <u>Hotels</u>: If you are a mid-range budget traveller, you will find a host of hotels and serviced apartments in almost every touristy town in Switzerland. A mid-range hotel would cost between SFr 150 and 300 per night.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Of course, if you are looking for luxury, there is almost no upper end to the spending on excellent Swiss hotels at prime locations. Many luxury hotels offer premium spa facilities, Michelin-starred restaurants and more.

                                            <u>Apartments</u>: There are plenty of serviced apartments available in towns all over Switzerland. Apartments come with kitchenettes and can be a good choice, especially if you are travelling as a large family group with kids and need some extra space. <a href="/apartments" class="lnks" target="_blank">Apartments in Switzerland</a> have been my personal choice on many occasions.

                                            Tip: If you are opting for hostels and are concerned about gender-specific accommodation, be sure to check the descriptions of the dormitories, as most of them are mixed-gender dorms.<br />
                                            Opt for accommodation in smaller towns to get better deals. This may mean that you have to travel a bit longer, but hey, this is Switzerland-more travel time means more Swiss scenery!

                                            The country has a remarkably efficient public transport system, but, like most things Swiss, it can be quite pricey. However, depending on your requirements, there are ways to best save your bucks.

                                            <u>City Cards</u>:  Most hotels offer their guests city cards that allow free public transportation within the city or municipality (the area that receives the city tax that you pay) for the number of days booked. These cards also offer entries or discounts on local attractions.
                                        </p>

                                            <u>Half-Fare Card</u>:  This card is valid for a month and costs SFr120. Once you have this, you basically get 50% off on every train, bus and boat ride. If you are travelling for say, around 2 weeks, and are staying a couple of nights or more in each town, the combination of this and the free city cards is just perfect. The Swiss Half-Fare Card also allows your child under 16 years of age to travel free!

                                            <u>Swiss Travel Pass</u>: Although some may disagree, this pass is the best option, despite being slightly more expensive than others.. The sheer convenience it offers makes it worthwhile if you, like most tourists, want to cover as much as possible within a limited time frame.<br />
                                            The Swiss Travel Pass provides unlimited access to all modes of transport for the specified number of days. Additionally, you can enjoy discounts of up to 50% on mountain railways and receive free admission to over 500 museums. As if this is not enough, your kids under 16 years of age travel free…even on the mountains!

                                            All you have to do is flash your <a href="/swiss-travel-pass" target="_blank" class='lnks'>Swiss Travel Pass</a> when boarding buses, boats, trains, and trams, and show it at the ticket counters of mountain excursions to receive the relevant discounts. Personally, for me, the Swiss Travel Pass is my go-to transport option every time I travel to Switzerland.

                                            Switzerland is packed with plenty to see and do- some for free and others that you can decide to spend on as per your budget.

                                        <p>
                                            If you want to keep your budget to a minimum, try to find all the lovely things that you can do for free. Simply wander through charming towns, visit local markets, and explore local churches and museums (most of which are free with the Swiss Travel Pass). Switzerland also hosts many cultural events and festivals that are free to attend.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            To experience nature's beauty and tranquillity, find walking, cycling or hiking trails and tracks in and around the towns that you are staying in.

                                            The popular sightseeing attractions in Switzerland revolve around its stunning Alps. Almost all, barring a couple of these mountain excursions, have a price, and the range is really varied. Some, like the Harder Kulm, can cost as little as SFr 22, while others, like the Jungfrau, can cost SFr 168 (these are costs for Swiss Travel Pass holders).
                                        </p>

                                            However, there are plenty of other mid-range excursions to choose from. If you want to visit a couple of these attractions, you can choose from popular ones like Mount Titlis, Matterhorn Glacier Paradise or Grindelwald First. Each is great in its own way- <a href="/mountain-excursion/5-mount-titlis" class="lnks" target="_blank">Mt Titlis</a> offers the chance to travel in the amazing revolving gondola ROTAIR.

Mountain cart and Trottibike.

                                            Eating out can be an expensive affair in Switzerland. A budget meal at a local eatery can cost around SFr 15-25, a mid-range meal at a small restaurant can cost around SFr 30-50.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            However, if your chosen accommodation has a kitchen, then you can buy your basic groceries at very affordable prices. Opting for a homemade breakfast and/or dinner will help save some money, which you can then use to cover more attractions.  Many restaurants also offer lunch specials at fixed times, so it's a good idea to look out for these as well.

                                            On our last trip to Switzerland, we did the following.<br />
                                            Considering that we were travelling with our 14-year-old daughter, we decided to opt for mid-range accommodation instead of hostels. We found a lovely apartment in a town called Meiringen, not too far from Interlaken and Lucerne. It also helped that we travelled in October once the summer rush had ended.<br />

                                            So with a well-thought-out plan and some clever budgeting, we did not have to break the bank for our 8-day <a href="/blog/switzerland-itinerary-8-days" class="lnks" target="_blank">holiday to Switzerland</a>. As you can see, at SFr 175 per person/day, we had a really comfortable stay - and managed to include some amazing attractions and experiences. To be honest, we did cross our miscellaneous budget by more than a little since we went sort of berserk buying chocolates at the <a href="/mountain-excursion/47-lindt-chocolate" class="lnks" target="_blank">Lindt Home of Chocolate</a> in Zurich!

                                            So, when planning your next European holiday, be sure to include Switzerland.<br />
                                            With a little foresight and smart planning, your dream Swiss vacation can become an unforgettable and affordable reality.

                                            Museums reveal the very essence of a place. They tell you how the place and its people evolved and adapted to their environment, as well as their art, cultures, and achievements. Switzerland’s museums do just that and so much more. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Switzerland boasts over 1000 museums (this is not a typo)! This tiny country boasts the world's highest density of museums. The museums are dedicated to a wide variety of topics, from science, history, transport, art, famous fictional personalities, humanitarian work, and more.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The best part is that the Swiss Travel Pass comes with a list of over 500 free museums!</p>

                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Experiences</h3>
                                        <p>Museums in Switzerland are not the typical ‘view and walk through’ experience. They offer fun and interactive exhibits that let you immerse yourself in the topics. Additionally, they have multimedia experiences and audio-guided tours.</p>

                                        </div>
                                        <p>Many children's museums offer hands-on experiences that combine sensory education with entertainment, providing a fun and engaging learning experience.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Unique topics</h3>
                                        <p>Switzerland is renowned for its chocolate, cheese, and extensive transport network, among other things, so it is no surprise that it has numerous museums devoted to these particularly popular subjects. </p>
                                        <p>However, there are some small but truly unique museums. I, for one, never imagined museums dedicated to toys, dolls, or paper. This country even has a museum dedicated to my favorite sleuth, Sherlock Holmes. </p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">History, art, and culture</h3>
                                        <p>The museums provide valuable insight into the country's evolution and its adaptation to the Alpine environment. They showcase how they overcame the hurdles of transport over mighty mountains like the <a href="/en-in/mountain-excursion/1-jungfraujoch-top-of-europe" class="lnks" target="_blank">Jungfraujoch</a> and <a href="/en-in/mountain-excursion/7-matterhorn-glacier-paradise" class="lnks" target="_blank">Matterhorn</a>. Switzerland is renowned for its art museums, featuring both modern collections and those dating back centuries.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Swiss weather</h3>
                                        <p>Museums are the perfect option on a cold or rainy day when you cannot venture outdoors or to the mountains.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Locations</h3>
                                        <p>Switzerland’s museums are scattered all over the country. Yes, the larger towns do have great museums, and many of them are located in each. However, there are also museums to be found in really quaint, typically Swiss towns, which are truly worth a visit. </p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Free Museum Access with the Swiss Travel Pass</h3>
                                        <p>Many travellers prefer to spend their money on visiting natural sights, activities, and monuments, unfortunately skipping museums due to budget constraints. In Switzerland, however, each museum has its own tariff, but you don't have to spend a dime if you hold a <a href="/swiss-travel-pass" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Travel Pass</a>. </p>

                                        <p>With limited time available on your Swiss vacation, you should plan your museum visits wisely. </p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Check opening and closing hours/holidays.</h3>
                                        <p>Ensure you check the museums' opening/closing hours to plan your day accordingly. Some museums may be open 7 days a week, while others have different hours.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Carry a pass and identification</h3>
                                        <p>Please carry your Swiss Travel Pass and another form of identification, as you may be required to present them for verification upon entry.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Check your daily travel route</h3>
                                        <p>Since the Swiss Travel Pass allows unlimited travel, review the route you will be taking each day to see if there are any fascinating museums not just at the destination, but also in towns along the way</p>
                                        <p>If you are staying at <a href="/apartments" class="lnks" target="_blank">apartments near Interlaken </a>and doing a day trip to the <a href="/en-in/mountain-excursion/1-jungfraujoch-top-of-europe" class="lnks" target="_blank">Jungfraujoch-Top of Europe</a> , you can visit the Grindelwald Museum along the way.Similarly, suppose you are staying at a <a href="/hotels" class="lnks" target="_blank">hotel</a>  or apartment in Lucerne and plan to visit <a href="/en-in/mountain-excursion/6-mount-pilatus" class="lnks" target="_blank">Mt. Pilatus</a>. In that case, you can see the museum in Kriens along the way and take a <a href="/en-in/mountain-excursion/34-saphir-panoramic-yacht-cruise" class="lnks" target="_blank">panoramic yacht cruise</a>   on Lake Lucerne in the evening.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Budget</h3>
                                        <p>Although over 500 museums are free with the Swiss Travel Pass, some, like the <a href="/en-in/mountain-excursion/35-swiss-transport-museum" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Museum of Transport</a> , offer discounts (not free entry). Make sure to check any such museums and budget accordingly</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Big City Days</h3>
                                        <p>Big cities like Zurich, Geneva, and Basel have multiple museums. If you want to visit more than one, then set aside a day for museum-hopping and conveniently use your Swiss Travel Pass to travel from one to the next in a well-planned route.</p>

                                        <p>You can also combine an evening activity with a day like this.

                                        <p>The prominent museums can also attract big crowds. If you want to avoid these, look out for the smaller, quirkier, and unique ones, which are just as interesting, and spend some quality time in them</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Look out for promotions</h3>

                                        <p>So, the next time you think of Switzerland, think beyond the mountains, watches, and chocolates. Delve into the museums as you wander through the towns and take in the fascinating history, culture, art, and so much more that they offer.</p>
                                        <p>You don’t even have to break the bank for this- just flash your Swiss Travel Pass, enter, browse, and enjoy!</p>

                                        <p>Perched on an outcrop on Lake Geneva, close to Montreux, is the Château de Chillon, Switzerland’s most visited historic building. It is a leisurely walk (around 4 km) or a short bus or train ride away from the centre of Montreux.</p>
                                        <p>Over the centuries, the castle has served many roles- armoury, fortress, prison, administrative centre, royal residence, and more.</p>
                                        <p>It has inspired writers and poets alike, who were all moved by its beauty, as well as its tales of suffering.  Lord Byron was inspired to write his famous poem, The Prisoner of Chillon, when he visited the dungeons in 1816.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">The Chapel of St George</h3>
                                        <p>Some consider the chapel to be the ‘jewel of Chillon’ with its vaulted Gothic ceiling and ornate decor.</p>

                                        <p>On the darker side, the history of the castle is replete with stories of how prisoners were chained, tortured, and starved in the cold underground dungeons. You can walk through these prison cells and see the worn stone pillars that still hold stories of the past.</p>

                                        <p>With a height of 23 metres and a width of 150 metres, the Rhine Falls are Europe’s largest waterfalls. The falls were formed over 15000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age.</p>

                                        <p>Hundreds of cubic metres of water crashing down over the 23 metres create a roar that is heard from miles away, and the mist often catches the sunlight in dazzling rainbows, giving it an ethereal glow.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Getting there</h3>
                                        <p>The Rhine Falls are conveniently reached via train from Zurich (or Zurich airport) with the help of the Swiss Travel Pass in two ways: either take the train to Schloss Laufen, which gets you to the Southern banks, or take the train to Neuhausen am Rheinfall, which gets you to the Northern banks.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">At the Falls</h3>
                                        <p>Take in the views of the falls from the viewing platforms (whilst being prepared to get sprayed by the mist). The platforms accessed via the south from Schloss Laufen am Rheinfall have a nominal fee, but get you really up close to the falls.</p>
                                        <p>The promenade views from the northern side (Neuhausen) are, however, free of charge.To get a different perspective, you can also walk along the pedestrian path on the rail bridge that crosses the river just above the falls.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Boat rides</h3>
                                        <p>From April to November, regular boat cruises are available for your choice. This is the best way to view the falls, as the boats take you right up close to them. One of the popular cruises is the Rock Tour, a 30-minute ride that takes you to the rock in the centre of the falls.</p>
                                        <p>You can disembark the boat here and climb up to the rock to get a 360-degree view of the falls from the viewing platform at the top. There are also various other cruises of different durations.</p>
                                        <p>You can combine a visit to the Rhine Falls with a visit to the medieval town of Stein Am Rhein, a city tour of Zurich, or an afternoon at the fantastic <a href="/mountain-excursion/47-lindt-chocolate" class="lnks" target="_blank">Lindt Home of Chocolate</a>.</p>

Whether you’re a seasoned art lover or someone who stops to appreciate a sculpture in a town square, garden, or park, Lugano offers artistic surprises at every turn.</p>
                                        <p>Lugano's art and culture museums are a testament to its rich artistic heritage. At the centre of its art scene is the MASI - Museo d’Arte della Svizzera Italiana, which offers a mix of contemporary art spanning the 19th and 20th centuries, with an emphasis on Swiss-Italian artists.</p>
                                        <p>It spans two spaces: The LAC (Lugano Arte e Cultura), a cultural centre devoted to the visual and performing arts and music, and the Palazzo Reali, which focuses on local Ticino art history, with an emphasis on older art, mainly from the 15th to the early 20th century.</p>
                                        <p>The cultural centre MUSEC (Museo delle Culture) is located on Lugano's lakeside in the historic Villa Malpensata. The centre hosts exhibitions and events dedicated to contemporary art, photography, ethnic, and Oriental arts.</p>
                                        <p>Combine an artistic day of art in Lugano with some fun family time at the <a href="/mountain-excursion/14-swiss-miniatur" class="lnks" target="_blank">Swiss Miniatur</a> (Switzerland’s largest open-air miniature museum) at Melide, just a short train or boat ride away from Lugano.</p>

                                        <p>Lovingly called the Queen of the Mountains, Mt. Rigi is one of the lower peaks just east of Lucerne and a perfect place for a picturesque day trip. This mountain, just under 1800 metres, has nine trains and cable cars that take you to it through stunning views of lakes and green, wildflower-covered pastures. The Vitznau-Rigi railway was Europe’s first mountain railway, opening in 1871.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">Getting there:</h3>
                                        <p>With multiple trains and cableways, there are various travel options. Let's have a look at the three main ways to get to Mt Rigi from Lucerne. </p>
                                        <p><b>Option 1: </b>By train to Arth Goldau, followed by the cogwheel to Rigi.</p>
                                        <p><b>Option 2: </b>By train to Vitznau, followed by the cogwheel to Rigi (one can also take a train/bus combination to Vitznau).</p>
                                        <p><b>Option 3: </b>By boat to Weggis and then the cable car to Rigi. However, this requires an uphill climb to the cable car station.</p>
                                        <h3 class="inlinetxt">At the peak</h3>
                                        <p>Walk along the paved path to the mountain's highest point for great views. The fenced-in viewing areas also make it safe for kids. You can also climb the weather tower for a higher vantage point (though not much higher).</p>
                                        <p>Peek into the lovely stone chapel, aptly named Regina Montium (Queen of the Mountains).</p>
                                        <p>Rigi offers over 100 km of well-paved hiking trails of varying difficulty levels to suit all types of travelers. These trails are the perfect way to take in views of the shimmering lakes, the surrounding region, and the peaks.</p>
                                        <p>Have a snack or meal at one of the restaurants, either at the peak or at  Rigi Kaltbad, one of the lower stations.</p>
                                        <p>Visit the spa at Rigi Kaltbad (literally meaning 'cold bath') and pamper yourself with a dip in one of the indoor or outdoor pools while gazing at the fantastic scenery. You can have a snack or a meal at one of the restaurants. If you're traveling with kids, consider visiting the mini golf course and playground at Kaltbad. </p>
                                        <p>Visit the Chaserenholz cheese dairy and take a tour. The dairy is accessed via a 20-minute downhill walk from the peak. They even offer popular local cheese dishes, such as raclette and fondue.</p>

                                        <p>It is almost certain that you will want to visit at least a couple of mountains on even the shortest trip to Switzerland. Based on your preferences, the region you'll be staying in, and your budget, it's advisable to make an informed choice. Try to get diverse experiences at each one.</p>
                                        <p><u>Snow:</u> Try to visit at least one mountain that guarantees snow year-round. Jungfrau, Titlis, and Matterhorn guarantee snow 365 days a year.</p>
                                        <p><u>Adventure:</u> Choose a mountain with toboggan runs, ziplines, trotti bikes, and kid-friendly activities, and more. Grindelwald First or Mt Pilatus would be a good choice for this.</p>
                                        <p><u>Photography: </u>Switzerland offers great photo ops at every turn, but nothing compares to the iconic shot of the Matterhorn. Head for the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise or the Gornergrat. Try the 5-Lakes walk at Gornergrat to capture the reflection of the Matterhorn in the lakes. </p>
                                        <p><u>Promotions:</u> Look out for the best deals on the Swiss Travel Pass and mountains. There are often ‘extra-day’ or ‘class-upgrade’ promotions on the Swiss Travel Pass during the off-season. </p>
                                        <p><u>Do your homework:</u> Make sure to check if the intended mountains are fully or partially included in the Swiss Travel Pass, the weather on each around the time of travel, the best time of day to beat the crowds, the best time for photography, etc.</p>
                                        <p>Get the most out of your Switzerland holiday with the Swiss Travel Pass- it is your ticket to comfort, convenience, flexibility, and savings. Make sure you take advantage of discounts on mountains, museums, and other attractions. Wait no further, lace up your hiking boots, pack the woolies, grab the camera, and set off for the Alps!</p>

                                        <p>This is simply because of the convenience and the zero risk if you miss or skip a train due to crowds.</p>
                                        <p>Yes, it may be a tad more expensive, especially if you don't need to travel daily. Still, it makes up for this in convenience, flexibility, and value-added features, such as complimentary museum entrances.</p>
                                        <p>For solo travellers and couples, if the daily program is well-planned in advance and you are willing to spend time searching for good deals and booking specific trains, the Swiss Half Fare Card will likely be a slightly cheaper option.</p>

                                        <p>Costs for these two itineraries are in Swiss Francs, valid for travel in October 2025, and based on purchasing segment tickets with the Half Fare Card approximately 3 weeks in advance.</p>
                                        <p>So, as we can see from these two programs, the pass that you should choose will depend on a couple of things - </p>
                                        <p>-Places, mountain excursions, and panoramic trains in Switzerland that you want to include.</p>
                                        <p>-How far in advance do you purchase the sector tickets? The earlier you buy them, the lower the prices (if you are prepared to commit to specific trains).</p>

                                        <p>For most itineraries, either one of the passes will cover most of what you want to do. However, if you plan on an extended stay (around 1 month or more), then combining the two passes can make sense.</p>
                                        <p>With a combination of the two, you can use the Swiss Travel Pass or the Flex version on days that you are doing scenic trains and museums, and use the Half Fare Card for other days. Consider combining the Swiss Travel Pass with another regional pass if you plan to travel extensively within a particular region.</p>
                                        <p>These details have helped you move closer to finding the ideal pass. With a bit of thought and planning, you’re sure to find the perfect travel companion to carry you seamlessly through the white Alps, emerald lakes, and clear blue Swiss sky!</p>

                                        <p>The Swiss Travel Pass comes in 2 versions - Consecutive and Flex.Both versions offer 1st- and 2nd-class travel and are available in durations of 3, 4, 6, 8, and 15 days.</p>

                                        <p>Both passes also offer a 30% discount to youth travellers aged 16-25. This youth discount, along with the Swiss Family Card, gives a significant price advantage to families.</p>

                                        <p><b><u>The Consecutive Day Pass</u></b> is validated for the chosen number of days from the first date of validity (usage) you enter whilst purchasing the pass.</p>

                                        <p>This pass is most beneficial when you are trying to cram in as much as possible within a short time frame. For example, if you have chosen a 4-day pass and want to travel to different towns almost each day, visit two mountain excursions and one or two museums.</p>

                                        <p><b><u>The Flex Pass</u></b> will also show the first date of validity you enter, but will allow you to use the chosen number of days non-consecutively within a one-month time frame.</p>

                                        <p>This version is more beneficial if you have a more extended stay and plan to hang out in your chosen towns for a few days rather than moving towns almost every day.</p>

                                        <p>You can request the <b><u>Swiss Family Card</u></b> when purchasing the Swiss Travel Pass. It is offered free of cost to children under 16 if the parents are Swiss Travel Pass holders. With this, the children can avail themselves of the same vast network of transportation, mountain railways, and museums, totally free.</p>

                                        <p>The <b><u>Swiss Travel Pass Youth</u></b> is offered to young travellers aged 16-25 and is an excellent way for them to explore the country at an affordable cost. The Youth Pass is available in both consecutive and flex versions.</p>

                                        <p>●	The pass you receive upon purchase is ready to use.</p>
                                        <p>●	You can keep the pass as a downloaded PDF document on your smartphone.</p>
                                        <p>●	You can also keep a paper copy (I always carry one just in case I have any issues with my phone).</p>
                                        <p>●	The pass has a QR code that train staff can scan for recordkeeping purposes.</p>
                                        <p>●	Just hop on the train or tram required and show the pass to the ticket checker upon request</p>

                                        <p>The validity period of the Swiss Travel Pass is measured in calendar days. The last day of the pass ends at 5 am the following morning, allowing you to do any late-night journey you may need.</p>

                                        <p>The time that you start your journey does not matter. So, for example, if you have purchased a 3-day pass starting 1st October, the pass is valid for travel on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd October and will end at 5 am on 4th October.</p>

                                        <p>You will see the relevant calendar dates here and can activate days as needed. Once you activate the day, you get an e-ticket for that day, which you can download to your phone and show to the ticket checker.</p>


                                        <p>You can also cancel a travel day up to the day before the chosen one.</p>

                                        <p>The validity period of the Swiss Travel Pass Flex is also measured in calendar days. You can use a day ticket until 5 am the following day.</p>

                                        <p><b>Note:</b> Keep in mind that you will not receive any benefit for travel, mountains, museums, family card, etc., on days that are not validated. This means that if you are staying in a town and need to travel, even for a short local bus or tram ride, you will have to purchase a full-fare ticket on those days.</p>

                                        <p>Now, this is subjective and can be viewed from the perspective of cost and convenience. It may not be a great money-saver in many itineraries, but the simplicity and convenience the pass offers make it totally worth its price.</p>
                                        <p>However, I do understand that if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck and are willing to do the math for it, then you will probably see that the Swiss Travel Pass will be a winner, especially when - </p>
                                        <p>-	You have a short stay and are going from city to city almost every day </p>
                                        <p>-	You are visiting multiple mountains, like <a href="/en-in/mountain-excursion/5-mount-titlis" class="lnks" target="_blank">Mount Titlis</a>, <a href="/en-in/mountain-excursion/7-matterhorn-glacier-paradise" class="lnks" target="_blank">Matterhorn Glacier Paradise</a>, and <a href="/en-in/mountain-excursion/6-mount-pilatus" class="lnks" target="_blank">Mount Pilatus</a>, during your stay.</p>
                                        <p>-	When you want to visit a few museums and attractions like the Chillon Castle or the Swiss Museum of Transport.</p>
                                        <p>-	And most certainly, when you have planned for journeys on Switzerland’s renowned panoramic trains like the <a href="/mountain-excursion/43-glacier-express" class="lnks" target="_blank">Glacier Express</a> and <a href="https://www.swisstours.com/mountain-excursion/42-bernina-express" class="lnks" target="_blank">Bernina Express</a>. Even though you have to pay for reservations on these trains, the train journeys themselves are totally covered on the pass.</p>

                                        <p>With the Swiss Travel Pass in hand, you can really hop onto any public transport, change your plans and do something spontaneous, not bother about reserving in advance (except on panoramic trains), and go where your heart desires. Just keep flashing your smile and your Swiss Travel Pass whenever the ticket checker asks.</p>

In every corner of the country, you will find large or small museums dedicated to diverse and unique subjects.

                                            <p>If your itinerary includes scattered travel days, consider the <b>Swiss Travel Pass Flex</b> for greater freedom.</p>
                                            <p>Reserve Scenic Trains Early</p>
                                            <p>Routes like the Glacier Express and Bernina Express require seat reservations, which can sell out in peak seasons.</p>
                                            <p>Coordinate with Hotel Locations</p>
                                            <p>Since Swiss cities are compact, pairing your pass with centrally located <a href="/en-in/" class="lnks" target="_blank"></a>reduces travel time and maximizes sightseeing.</p>
